&lt;p>Since making that &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">POG bomb&lt;/a> with Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/strains/london-tropics/">London Tropics&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/boost/thiol/">Thiol Boost&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the goldmine of thiol precursors in malts &amp;ndash; and malts alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given a lot more thiol precursors come from malts than hops, it probably makes more sense to play with different base malts and malt varieties than with new age hops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>German scientists have devised &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c06305">a solvent-free, automated method&lt;/a> for brewers to measure and track hop-derived thiols during the brewing process. How cool would it be, to be able to quantify the amount of thiol precursors in different malts, and find out which malt varieties pair the best with a particular thiolized yeast?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Most maltsters don&amp;rsquo;t list information about their grain varieties, only generic info like the malt type (pale, pilsner, crystal, etc). To find out the specific varietals of grains the malts are made from, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to ask the maltsters directly for COAs (certificates of analysis).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with enough grains (of different varieties) to know that the varietal can make a big difference in the end-product, e.g. a bread made from 100% &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/turkey-red/">Turkey Red&lt;/a> is noticeably different from one made from 100% &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/joaquin-oro/">Joaquin Oro&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/white-sonora/">Sonora Blanca&lt;/a>. In pale ales, modern barley varieties like Metcalfe and Copeland from Montana or western Canada may be more suited to the American style than the others, while heirloom varieties like Golden Promise or Maris Otter add a bit of nutty character to British variations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many brewers proudly describe their base malts &amp;ndash; the vast majority of the grist in most beers &amp;ndash; simply as &amp;ldquo;2-row.&amp;rdquo; That label merely indicates it&amp;rsquo;s not the &amp;ldquo;inferior&amp;rdquo;, higher-protein 6-row barley variety. But those are broad categories &amp;ndash; just like &lt;a href="https://newenglandapples.org/2020/10/16/russets-small-size-big-flavor/">russet&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.chelseagreen.com/2022/surprisingly-sweet-crab-apples/">crab&lt;/a>, and club are categories of apples (so much for the Johnny Appleseed fairy tale) &amp;ndash; and imply nothing about the actual barley variety, even less about how the grain is malted. Most brewers just take whatever malt variety is available, maybe occasionally thinking about 2-row vs. 6-row, winter vs. summer, maltster vs. maltster, and US-Canada vs. Europe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As with wheat, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that if a malt is generic enough to be characterized by just its category, it&amp;rsquo;s not going to give the end-product much flavor or character. But what really made me appreciate malt as a craft, in and of itself, was 2 things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Learning how to make traditional Baltic peasant rye bread from single-variety grain (rye) during 2020 COVID lockdown. In rural villages in Belarus and Latvia, for example, grandmas still make some of the world&amp;rsquo;s most flavorful (and underrated) breads today &amp;ndash; with only rye flour, water, salt, and natural yeast; they coax incredibly complex flavors out of the unassuming rye kernel through different stages of chemical reactions. That inspired me to malt my own rye for breadmaking: pale rye malt, Russian red fermented rye malt (&lt;em>solod&lt;/em>), chocolate rye malt, and even malt syrup, from different varieties of rye (Abruzzi, Gazelle, Hazlet, Ryman, &lt;em>Svedjerug&lt;/em>, Prima, etc). I was absolutely mesmerized by the different flavor profile and intensity each rye malt (and each rye variety) added to the final bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Studying European beer history. European beer styles evolved in tandem with local barley varieties and malt. Particularly in places like Bavaria, &lt;em>Helles&lt;/em> (pale lagers) &amp;ndash; despite being delicately hopped and regularly made with just a single malt &amp;ndash; taste different across breweries, because the malt, which is the whole ballgame, is different. Breweries have access to dozens of different malthouses, each making their pilsner malts slightly differently, from a range of different barley varieties. The same is true &amp;ndash; and even more pronounced &amp;ndash; in the UK, where ale brewers not only know which facility makes their malt, but also have passionate opinions about the barley variety. In cask ales, for example, the differences between different barley varieties and malts are magnified, creating distinct flavors.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>One of the factors that contributed to the development of the brewing industry as a whole was the spread of pale malts. In the Late Middle Ages, England had been struggling with wood shortages and switched to using the cheaper coal. A major problem with coal was that it produces sulfurous fumes during burning, and the flavors imparted to malt dried in coal-fueled kilns &amp;ndash; and subsequently the beer &amp;ndash; were &lt;a href="https://www.beeretseq.com/where-theres-smoke-theres-pale-ale/">not acceptable&lt;/a>. Hence, in &lt;em>ye olden times&lt;/em> malt had to be dried over wood, peat, or straw &amp;ndash; all of which infused malt with the smoky character of the heat source and gave it a brown color &amp;ndash; or the best Welsh anthracite, the supply of which was quite limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1603, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Plat">Sir Hugh Plat&lt;/a> suggested that coal might be charred in a manner analogous to the way charcoal is produced from wood. He heated some coal without burning it, which distilled the coal, removed its offensive sulfurous smell, and left a residue with a high carbon content and few impurities. This was coke, which proved to be a highly useful fuel for heating and industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The coke process remained unnoticed until 1642, when malt makers in Derbyshire began to employ coke for roasting malt. Coke demonstrated superior qualities over other fuels at the time: It generates a great deal of heat without the attendant soot and smoke, and it allows better thermal control. Coke-dried malt was considered an improvement in quality over wood-dried malt, and brought about an &amp;ldquo;alteration which all England admired.&amp;rdquo; Brewers were finally able to mass-produce a lighter roast of the malt that was not &amp;ldquo;smoked.&amp;rdquo; This malt was called &amp;ldquo;pale,&amp;rdquo; and it led to the creation of what by the end of the 17th century was called &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp;quot;&lt;strong>pale ale&lt;/strong>.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> Coke became the &lt;em>cr√®me de la cr√®me&lt;/em> of fuels in England. Coke-fired blast furnaces made the production of inexpensive cast iron possible, which was one of the factors that drove the Industrial Revolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The British Empire was in full sway, with merchants and traders traveling around the world. India was the &amp;ldquo;crown jewel&amp;rdquo; of the empire, hosting a large British military and civilian population with a thirst for beer. The tropical climate in India made local brewing of typical English pale ales impossible. Casks of porters and stouts shipped in from England fared poorly because of the long sea voyage and temperature fluctuations; bottled products produced mixed results as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1790, George Hogeson of the Bow Brewery in London developed a recipe for pale ale that included a huge increase in hops and a much higher alcohol content (both known to have preservative qualities). The export casks were primed with sugar and dry-hopped prior to shipping. The resulting beer arrived in India unspoiled, but much stronger and hoppier than the domestic version. This &amp;ldquo;India Pale Ale&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong>IPA&lt;/strong>) quickly became hugely popular and profitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pale malt has a huge advantage over darker malts: It contains more enzymes and more fermentable sugars, which allows for more efficient beer production; the taste of the finished beer is much cleaner, as yeasts are able to break down a higher percentage of the chemical compounds dissolved in wort. This fact was likely not explicitly known to brewers until the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrometer#Saccharometer">saccharometer&lt;/a> was invented in the late 18th century. Given that coke was too expensive for commercial brewing back then, pale ales remained mostly exclusive to the households of the wealthy gentry in northern England.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the US, light lager was the focus of domestic breweries until ~2000. The specific needs of breweries for producing this style of beer trumped the beer&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;character&amp;rdquo; development. 2-row malt is good enough; the barley and malt industries became streamlined to efficiently produce this neutral, light-flavored product for the purpose of brewing domestic light lagers. This specialization, however, created a structural problem for craft breweries looking for malt flavors &amp;ndash; worse, it led to a zymurgic myopia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, American breweries don&amp;rsquo;t have nearly the selection of malts that Germans have. Weyermann, a common source, makes a high-quality pilsner malt from 2-row spring barley. Brewers love its strong, distinctive character, which really makes a lager pop. The problem is every lager tastes like Weyermann¬Æ pilsner malt, which is why so many breweries in Bavaria use different malthouses to differentiate their beers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Craft brewing has gone through eras of hop enlightenment and yeast consciousness. Not too long ago, brewers were content with a handful of C-hops and some Chico yeast. Now hop breeders release dozens of new hops a year; yeast labs and yeast varieties are mushrooming. Brewers are constantly tinkering with ingredients to produce new flavors, and highly attuned to subtle differences.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I ask my maltsters to include the barley variety mix in their analysis data. Having a malt analysis without varietal data is like describing a dog without knowing the breed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dan Carey, New Glarus Brewing&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It seemed like a watershed moment when we first scratched the surface of &amp;ldquo;biotransformation&amp;rdquo; and, subsequently, the effect of ester-rich yeasts on IPAs. As this style has evolved by leaps and bounds, we have gained a better understanding of how hops interact with different processes &amp;ndash; and with yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How might different base malts affect beers?&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>America does have a number of &lt;a href="https://craftmalting.com/">craft malthouses&lt;/a>. Although many aren&amp;rsquo;t yet able to supply breweries with a reliable source of base malts for a year of regular-production beer, things might change with growing interest that will allow them to increase production and lower prices to compete with mass-produced malts. Some of these craft malts are not only interesting and flavorful, but also benefit the local economy and environment. A world with dozens of small, viable malthouses has the potential to transform beer tremendously, like hops and yeasts did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the single-origin base malts crafted by &lt;a href="https://www.gallatinvalleymalt.com/">Gallatin Valley Malt&lt;/a> (a farmer-owned craft malthouse in Manhattan, Montana) are quite distinct from the same types I&amp;rsquo;ve tried from several other malthouses (including &lt;a href="https://montanacraftmalt.com/">Montana Craft Malt&lt;/a>, which is located only ~1 hour away from Gallatin Valley Malt).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Heather Sargent, Head Maltstress at Gallatin Valley Malt, articulates the variability to me:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Malts will generally vary in flavor and analysis between malt houses for several reasons. Where the barley is grown and how it&amp;rsquo;s grown play a huge part in the quality that the Maltster has to work with. Whether or not the grain is blended is another factor. Dry farming vs. irrigated. The way in which the grain is malted. Therefore, brewers can make their determinations based on the outcomes and what they like.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That means, there are thousands of variations in just the &amp;ldquo;pale malt&amp;rdquo;! And the malt that goes into the recipe matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Breweries' chalkboards and printed menus often boast hop varieties, hoping (often correctly) that words like Citra, Enigma, or Lemondrop will entice customers to order a pint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s rare, literally unheard of, for a brewery to advertise the malt bill on a menu (although it does show up from time to time on labels). The most overlooked ingredient can mean the difference between an enjoyable pint and a drain pour, and even help a brewery stand out and differentiate itself from the pack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In what appears to be a fairly mature industry, craft malts have a chance to inject a new wave of innovation into our glasses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The varieties of the grains that go into the malt are just as important as the hops that go into the wort. And not only the variety, but also the growing region (terroir) affects the malt&amp;rsquo;s flavor, haze, and foam stability.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="saccharified-mash">Saccharified mash&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I limited thiol precursor-loaded, diastatic barley malt to 30% of total grains in the mash; the rest was all adjuncts, as far as diastatic powers and thiol precursors are concerned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The light-golden &lt;a href="https://www.gallatinvalleymalt.com/gallatin-pale">pale malt&lt;/a> by Gallatin Valley Malt, made from Genie barley (grown, harvested, and malted right on GVM&amp;rsquo;s own farm in Montana&amp;rsquo;s breadbasket, the fertile &lt;a href="https://bozemanmagazine.com/articles/2018/09/04/102964-gallatin-agricultural-history">Gallatin Valley&lt;/a>, in a true field-to-kiln fashion), has an endearing aroma of sweet biscuits out of the box. When freshly ground, the malt tastes like Honey Nut Cheerios with a yummy sunflower seed butter drizzle &amp;ndash; none of the grass/straw/hay notes I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed in pale malts from some other malthouses.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Total: 400g&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I milled the grains into a flour, and mixed everything with water. I intentionally kept the mash thick, because I wanted to create an Italian &lt;em>lievito madre&lt;/em>-style stiff barm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mash then went through&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After saccharification, the mash tasted brightly sweet and malty &amp;ndash; it reminded me of &lt;em>cannel√©s bordelais&lt;/em> drizzled with a decadent caramel sauce. GVM&amp;rsquo;s flagship &lt;a href="https://www.gallatinvalleymalt.com/gallatin-pale">pale malt&lt;/a> well deserved the silver medal at the 2022 Craft Maltsters Guild.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="barm">Barm&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>People seem to love to hate on the &amp;ldquo;Chico&amp;rdquo; strain. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing the main reason is that it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; strain that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get you &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; flavors like some other yeasts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, Jeremy Myers, head of production for Bachs Biermanufaktur in Saarland, Germany, &lt;a href="https://beerandbrewing.com/cold-healthy-and-crowded-lager-fermentation-simplified/">suggests&lt;/a> using White Labs WLP001 for lagers. He says &amp;ldquo;fermenting cold with that yeast leaves behind a beer with just the kind of clean, crisp flavor we want in a lager.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IMO, &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; strains like WLP001 are clean, versatile, low-ester, and low-phenol. They can be super useful and valuable in the right context. For example, they are &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/wlp001/">terrific for breads&lt;/a> that are intended to highlight a grain&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>terroir&lt;/em>. If you ferment a few doughs with WLP001, keeping everything the same except the flours (use different varieties of wheat, e.g. Joaquin Oro vs. Sonora Blanca vs. Turkey Red), I bet you&amp;rsquo;d taste different flavors and &amp;ldquo;grain-forwardness&amp;rdquo; in each baked product. At least I did. In the &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-1-2/">whole wheat bread&lt;/a> I made with WLP001, the yeast elevated the character of Turkey Red to such a degree that I never thought it was possible (with sourdough or bread yeast), and produced a stunningly pure, robust wheat flavor without the slightest hint of acidity &amp;ndash; it was like eating a box of Triscuit Original or drinking an American wheat beer. Pure, authentic, natural wheatopia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like how the Chico strain drove IPA 2.0 due to its &amp;ldquo;cleanness&amp;rdquo; that emphasizes malt and allows hops to shine through, I think it has the potential to do the same thing for Pizza/Bread 3.0 (especially when coupled with the &amp;ldquo;local grain&amp;rdquo; movement). Clean strains highlight the humble grain and let the grain flavor shine through, much more so than sourdough or bread yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this case, I scooped out 140g of the cooled mash (260g remaining), and added a 50/50 blend of &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/london-tropics/">London Tropics&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/wlp001/">WLP001 California ale yeast&lt;/a>. I intended to temper the thiol levels and let other characteristics stand out, to create a multi-layered, balanced bouquet of tropical aromas/flavors. (ICYMI, London Tropics proved to be an incredibly powerful &amp;ldquo;weapon of mass thiolization&amp;rdquo; in my &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">last experiment&lt;/a>.)&lt;/p>
&lt;table>

&lt;tr>
&lt;td>California ale yeast (WLP001 - White Labs)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>0.5%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>0.7g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Total: 141.4g&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I added both yeasts at the same time, since they have similar optimal temperature range. I let the barm ferment, loosely covered, at 68-72¬∞F for ~18 hours. The barm doubled in volume by the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">last time&lt;/a>, POG-type tropical aromas started to manifest ~3 hours in, but never got as pungent, which was expected, since the amount of precursors in the mash was drastically reduced and the inoculation rate of thiolized yeast was halved.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="final-dough">Final dough&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This time, I decided to make a batch of &lt;em>bomboloni&lt;/em> (yeasted Italian donuts), instead of a loaf of bread. And I intentionally made these &lt;em>bomboloni&lt;/em> much more austere than &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/california-dreamin-5/">the Sonora Blanca version&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>These donuts had a super fluffy, airy texture, almost completely concealing the fact they were made from unsifted whole grains. They also had a substantial mouthfeel &amp;ndash; quite contrary to the emptiness I always experience when eating donuts from national donut chains, which tend to be so overloaded with sugar that they melt in your mouth like cotton candy (in a bad way).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tropical aroma was hard to distinguish underneath the cinnamon sugar coating, but a ripe fruit flavor was noticeable in the crumb, alongside an unyielding wheat flavor. It mildly reminded me of Kellogg&amp;rsquo;s Tropical Froot Loops cereal. Definitely not POG bombs this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I think these thiol-complimentary &lt;em>bomboloni&lt;/em> turned out much more balanced and delectable than my &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">last thiol-dominant bake&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; once again, proving &amp;ldquo;more isn&amp;rsquo;t always better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, I don&amp;rsquo;t think the flavor was quite right &amp;ndash; it didn&amp;rsquo;t have the multi-layered bouquet of aromas/flavors I was expecting. Something was still amiss.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As mentioned in my &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-1-1/">last breadpost&lt;/a>, &lt;strong>barm&lt;/strong> is simply a thick yeasty froth or scum formed on the top of a fermenting liquid, like beer or wine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original method of making yeast bread in Britain was a by-product of ale-making. When traditional ale is made, a yeasty froth appears on top of the fermenting liquid (the wort). This used to be scooped off, washed, and then added to bread dough as a leaven. Bread made this way is sweet, light, and fluffy, and the leavening yeast used to be called &amp;ldquo;barm&amp;rdquo;. Its unpredictability gives us the word &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp;ldquo;barmy&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Barm first appeared in written records before the 12th century. It came from Middle English &lt;em>berme&lt;/em>, which came from Old English &lt;em>beorma&lt;/em>; it&amp;rsquo;s akin to Middle Low German &lt;em>berm&lt;/em> (yeast), Latin &lt;em>fermentum&lt;/em> (yeast), &lt;em>fervƒìre&lt;/em> (to boil), and Old Irish &lt;em>berbaid&lt;/em> (he boils). The word has been in use more loosely since the 13th century in reference to the foam or &amp;ldquo;head&amp;rdquo; of a pint of beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using barm to leaven bread appears to be an ancient method developed by Gaelic peoples in the mists of time (no wonder Scottish bakers were the last in Britain to ditch baking with barm), and was quite different from that used in Europe, i.e. leaven bread with a sourdough or leaven (called &amp;ldquo;levain&amp;rdquo; in French). When the Romans first conquered Gaul (modern-day France), they were astonished by the light sweet bread made by the Celtic inhabitants. Barm bread survived with the Celtic peoples in Britain, Scotland and √âire, but was not common in Europe &amp;ndash; in fact, it was even condemned during the Enlightenment as &amp;ldquo;unwholesome&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In England, noblemen&amp;rsquo;s bread &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchet">manchet&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; was always made with barm, whereas the commoners' bread &amp;ldquo;maslin&amp;rdquo; was usually leavened with a sourdough. Barm bread survived until World War II &amp;ndash; and even later in northern England largely as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barm_cake">barm cakes&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 19th century, the barm process was refined and industrialized; &amp;ldquo;yeast&amp;rdquo; began to be manufactured on a large scale, and used worldwide as &lt;em>the&lt;/em> method to leaven bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Curiously, the old method of making a sponge, i.e. a thick batter of flour and water with the barm, was still used with the new industrially-produced yeast, and was re-introduced to Europe from Vienna where the first yeast factories were established. Viennese bakers who emigrated to France around 1840 initiated the production of Viennese breads and other luxury bakery products in Paris using such technique. This became popular in France as a &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://bakerpedia.com/processes/poolish/">poolish&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; (an Old English version of &amp;ldquo;Polish&amp;rdquo;, as this method was first developed in Poland); bakers switched from using combinations of yeast and sourdough (&lt;em>sur levain&lt;/em>) to yeast alone for making crusty bread such as baguettes at bakeshops.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>At the beginning of the 20th century, barm was no longer universally held in high esteem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A 1902 domestic science book, &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://chestofbooks.com/food/science/Handbook-Of-Household-Science/Yeasts-Part-2.html">Hand-Book Of Household Science&lt;/a>&lt;/em> by Juniata L. Shepperd, considered acidity in barm bread a defect:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There is another variety of patent yeast known as &amp;ldquo;flour barm.&amp;rdquo; This is extensively used in Scotland. The chief peculiarity of bread from this is its decidedly acid taste, thought to be due principally to lactic acid. Much salt is used in making this bread, and it has not the flavor of what, in some other countries, is called the best bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A decade later, James Grant wrote in &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://archive.org/stream/grantsbreadchem00granrich/grantsbreadchem00granrich_djvu.txt">The Chemistry Of Breadmaking&lt;/a>&lt;/em> (1912):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Bread prepared by the aid of barms is generally of poor volume and colour, rather liable to be holey, with dull bloom and texture somewhat variable, but the flavour as a rule is good. Barms are suitable for working strong, harsh flours by long, slow processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Hmmmm. The artisanal, open-crumb, slightly tangy, naturally leavened bread &lt;em>en vogue&lt;/em> all over the US today was not beloved in Europe a century ago.&lt;/p>

alt="WLP001 whole-wheat barm bread"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>whole-wheat barm bread, leavened exclusively with White Labs' WLP001 California ale yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Interestingly, the old barm method survived the invasions of Romans, Saxons and Normans. Which makes sense because it produced the sweetest, lightest bread in the right hands. Like other ancient breads, barm bread was highly digestible and nutritious because the ferments were never single strains like they are today, and included lactic acid bacteria which also gave the bread a marvelous flavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Barm bread has recently enjoyed some revival because it&amp;rsquo;s a characteristic ancient bread of Britain, a true heritage. Today some British bakers still add ale to bread dough to give it the ancient flavor, which sets the British bread culture apart from others. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame that the process was &lt;a href="https://sourdough.com/blog/enzyme-bread-tech">bastardized by industrialization&lt;/a> to produce modern unwholesome yeast breads.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="how-to-get-barm">how to get barm&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>So how do you get barm? There are several ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Option #1: You can always ask your neighborhood &lt;strong>craft brewers&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>home-brewing friends&lt;/strong> for some spare barm. It can be an interesting educational process, as apparently an ancient law declares that the brewer is bound to accede to your request. Your first task, though, is to convince the brewer that you mean to create bread with the barm and not a rival beer!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Option #2: &lt;a href="http://www.danlepard.com/">Dan Lepard&lt;/a>, an Australian-British baking celeb, has a famous &lt;strong>shortcut for a quick barm&lt;/strong> in his book &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://www.thehandmadeloaf.com/">The Handmade Loaf&lt;/a>&lt;/em>, intended for people who don&amp;rsquo;t have malts and hops lying around the kitchen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, it involves gelatinizing 1 part of white flour with 5 parts of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewing#Bottle_conditioning">bottle-conditioned&lt;/a> ale (heated to 158¬∞F/70¬∞C), letting it cool off to room temperature, and then inoculating with 0.4 part of leaven or yeast culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried his recipe, because there seems to be some weird contradiction. I bet a lot of people assume that the live yeast in the beer has something to do with making the bread rise. Nope, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Heating a fresh bottle of beer to &amp;gt;104¬∞F (40¬∞C) kills the live yeast in it, long before it reaches 158¬∞F/70¬∞ where you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to whisk in the flour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You use bottle-conditioned beer for the same reasons you use freshly milled organic flour &amp;ndash; a bottle-conditioned beer has more flavor than one without. If you don&amp;rsquo;t understand these reasons, the recipe will still work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe the purpose of heating the beer is to cook off some of the alcohol, which retards the action of yeast. Lepard was effectively using the beer as a flavoring, and then re-introducing yeasts via a leaven; however lovely the results may be, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>not&lt;/em> a genuine barm bread. Lepard also says this is a perfect replica of the complex barm of the old times for the home bakers. Meh. I&amp;rsquo;m not satisfied with this method nor do I care for shortcuts. I want to make a barm from scratch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which leads me to option #3: &lt;strong>DIY from scratch&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>William Jago&amp;rsquo;s 1911 classic, &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/technologyofbrea00jagorich">The Technology of Bread-Making&lt;/a>&lt;/em>, gives three variations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>compound barm (malt and hops);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>virgin barm (spontaneous fermentation with flour and water only); and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parisian barm (malt and flour).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Compound barm&amp;rdquo; is essentially unboiled wort, made with malt, hops and water, and then inoculated with an existing culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Virgin barm&amp;rdquo;, containing only water and flour, differs from a sourdough starter in that it&amp;rsquo;s made with boiling water, i.e. the flour is gelatinized. Virgin barm should be left alone to ferment spontaneously, but even in 1911 bakers added &amp;ldquo;store&amp;rdquo; (an existing culture) to speed up the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Parisian barm&amp;rdquo; includes malt again, together with scalded flour, but no hops. Virgin barm differed from Parisian only in being self-fermented.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m interested in creating a barm that will increase the biodiversity of yeasts and maximize the aroma/flavor of the bread.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>John Kirkland, in his 1927 book &lt;em>The Baker‚Äôs ABC&lt;/em>, wrote about barm:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;since bakers, or others for them, began to make a fermenting agent for themselves, about 1800, that has been described as bar, while the word yeast has been retained for the brewery product, as well for the more modern article sold in more solid form. Barm contains yeast cells, generally as a variety of species, as well as some of the liquor in which the yeast has been grown. Barms are of many kinds and all degrees of ‚Äústrength‚Äù; that is, a particular lot may contain few or many yeast cells and much or little of the acids, peptones, alcohols, &amp;amp;c., which have resulted from earlier fermentations. Probably the earliest barm made, as distinguished from leavens &amp;ndash; was that from malt and hops as the baker in the first instance merely copied the brewer or the distiller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This barm was known as compound or comp or patents. Some makers used a quantity of flour in the mixture, some did not. In Scotland, where barms were first made and where they continue in favour, the compound barm was displaced by a kind made with &lt;strong>scalded flour and malt&lt;/strong>. To this was given the name of &amp;ldquo;Parisian&amp;rdquo;, although no precise evidence to show that it was copied from the practice of Parisian bakers. Another sort which may contain a little malt , but may be all scalded and raw flour, is called ‚ÄúVirgin barm‚Äù.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If there is such a thing as a &amp;ldquo;Parisian barm&amp;rdquo;, then I first learned this &amp;ldquo;scalded flour and malt&amp;rdquo; method from &lt;em>Russian&lt;/em> bakers, not Parisians.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Parisian barm was introduced from Paris to Scotland in the late 19th century. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a scientific modification of the techniques of ancient Egypt and modern France.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>William Jago&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/technologyofbrea00jagorich">The Technology of Bread-Making&lt;/a>&lt;/em>, mentioned above, does offer a recipe for &amp;ldquo;Parisian barm&amp;rdquo;, supplied by a Mr. J. Meikle, who was apparently a well-known baker and bread writer familiar with the Scottish baking trade. Meikle&amp;rsquo;s descriptions show an evolution of baking practice beginning with, and developing away from, beer-brewing techniques.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is very similar to the &lt;em>opara&lt;/em> (yeasted scald-sponge) method I&amp;rsquo;ve always relied on to make complex Baltic rye breads.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Why does Wells include hops in Parisian barm and Jago doesn&amp;rsquo;t? I speculate there might be a few reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm made with hops is able to &amp;ldquo;overcome the power of foreign ferments longer than that made without hops, because the bitter of the hops is not suited to bacterial growth&amp;rdquo;, according to Shepperd&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>&lt;a href="http://chestofbooks.com/food/science/Handbook-Of-Household-Science/Yeasts-Part-2.html%20">Hand-Book Of Household Science&lt;/a>&lt;/em> (1902). However, &amp;ldquo;one can use but little of a yeast made with hops without injuring the flavor of the bread, and a weak yeast acts so slowly as to cause disastrous results, it is better to make yeast oftener without hops, and use plenty of it in bread making.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Since barm without hops didn&amp;rsquo;t keep as well, maybe some bakers just continued using hops to prevent barm spoilage while others didn&amp;rsquo;t. Pasteurisation arrived in the late 1870s and fewer hops were needed as a preservative. It certainly shows that disputes over what is or isn&amp;rsquo;t a poolish, a sourdough, a barm, etc. predate internet bread-geek forums.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Hopstalgia, i.e. carryover from tradition or reverence for the old days, when barm used to be made from malt and hops as the baker copied the brewer/distiller. As mentioned above, one of the reasons that bakers moved away from beer yeast in the first place was because the hops made it unpleasantly bitter. The older generations who had grown up eating hoppy barm bread most likely developed an acquired taste and nostalgia for it. Compound barm (malt and hops), for example, was considered by many of the older bakers to be &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>the&lt;/em> barm for flavour in bread&amp;rdquo;, according to Jago&amp;rsquo;s 1911 &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/technologyofbrea00jagorich">book&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 1: gelatinize the flour&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Put the whole wheat flour in a bowl; add hot water in 2-3 increments, stirring constantly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 2: saccharify the scald&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add the malt at the end (to prevent malt enzymes from being destroyed) and mix again. Cover and hold at 150-155¬∞F for 6 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The scald becomes sweet/saccharified, since the diastatic malt contains amylase that converts starch into simple sugars. Saccharifying literally means &amp;ldquo;to convert into sugar.&amp;rdquo; Or, in more scientific words, saccharifying is the process of converting a sugar derivative or complex carbohydrate into a simple soluble fermentable sugar by hydrolysis.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Why scald the flour first?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order for the scald (&amp;ldquo;mash&amp;rdquo; in brewing) to be successful, we need heat and water to gelatinize the starch granules, essentially opening up their inner depths to expose the starch chains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, heat and water alone don&amp;rsquo;t break down starch into simpler sugars &amp;ndash; not on their own, anyway. In order to do that, we need enzymes. Malted barley, particularly pale (diastatic) malt, is packed with natural enzymes that can break down these long starch chains into much shorter fermentables that can be metabolized by yeasts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To the plant, starch serves as a reserve of energy that the embryo plant can use when it starts to germinate. In late summer to early fall, the seed falls off the stalk. If it immediately starts to grow after hitting the ground, it would grow too much before winter and not survive the cold. This also means that the seed comes off the stalk in a storage form known as starch, which is very hardy and doesn&amp;rsquo;t degrade nearly as quickly as sugar. So the seed will just sit in a field until the time is right for it to start growing. Then, when that time comes, many complex biological and chemical changes start to kick in, converting the starches into readily available sugars for the growing plant. Enzymes in the seed will activate, start degrading the cell walls, and break down the long chemical chains of starch into the short chains of maltose (a simple sugar). The growing plant can utilize this maltose until its stalk has poked above the surface of the ground, starting to produce its own sugar through photosynthesis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Malting mimics this natural process, so we can activate those enzymes that will convert the starch into sweet, tasty maltose that yeast loves to eat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Certain enzymes are produced during the malting process; the two major ones are Œ±-amylase and Œ≤-amylase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A-amylase basically liquefies starch and turns it into a carbohydrate stew. It also chops up the starch at 1-4 links. Every time it cuts the chain, a reducing end and a non-reducing end are formed on the chain. Œí-amylase can work only on the non-reducing end. It will lop off 2 molecules of the carb stew and blend with one water molecule, producing maltose. B-amylase also can lop off 3 molecules of starch, mixing with one water molecule producing maltriose. Maltriose is the sugar that yeast use during lagering phase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After Œ±-amylase and Œ≤-amylase can reduce the chain no further, Œ±-limit and Œ≤-limit dextrins are formed. Œ≤-limit dextrin can chop the starch down to a 1-6 link. Once, the enzyme gets to a branch, they&amp;rsquo;re done. Enzymes such as dextrinase and maltase are de-branching enzymes, typically destroyed during the kilning of modern malts. There are a limited amount left in minimally modified pilsner malt. De-branching enzymes help Œ±-amylase and Œ≤-amylase produce many non-reducing ends. The more the non-reducing ends, the more Œ≤-amylase has to work with &amp;ndash; and faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brewers typically boil their wort after mashing to sanitize it and to boost hop utilization (among other things), which denatures all the enzymes. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t nuke the saccarified scald like brewers (leaving it a &amp;ldquo;raw ale&amp;rdquo;), I get to keep the valuable secondary enzymes in play for more starch conversion to take place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondary enzymes, compared to their amylase cousins, aren&amp;rsquo;t very active under thermophilic conditions. However, they do become more active during mesophilic fermentation and give us a &amp;ldquo;secondary conversion&amp;rdquo; in beerspeak. This secondary conversion actually increases the amount of fermentable sugars by as much as 15%, which is a huge boost to plant efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like a beer mash, there are many kinds of sugars in saccharified scald:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>fructose, glucose, and sucrose: ~30%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>maltose: ~45%, which, like trehalose, is made from 2 glucose molecules, but with a different bond between them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>maltotriose: ~20%, which is 3 glucose molecules, with the exact same bond between them as in maltose.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The increased concentration of sugar could lead to caramelization, which makes the beer less fermentable (among other things). Since I&amp;rsquo;m not after alcohol production, this is not a problem. In fact, the extra sugar might even enhance the flavor profile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, I used &lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=101&amp;amp;type=YEAST">WLP001 California ale yeast&lt;/a> in this barm. WLP001 has an attenuation rate of 73%-85%.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In brewing, attenuation refers to the conversion of sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide by the fermentation process; the greater the attenuation, the more sugar has been converted into alcohol. A more attenuated beer is drier and more alcoholic than a less attenuated beer made from the same wort. High-attenuating yeast indicates that the particular strain ferments more of the sugars available in a wort relative to other yeast strains. This results in a drier finish in the finished beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A 50% attenuation rate means that 50% of the sugars have been converted into alcohol and CO‚ÇÇ by yeast. A 100% attenuation means all of the sugars have been consumed by yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beer fermented with normal brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast will never have 100% attenuation. A 100% fermentable sugar solution will only attenuate to the level that the yeast can tolerate the alcohol or lack of nutrients; whereas in a wort that contains 30% non-fermentables; a yeast that can go to 80% attenuation will stop at 70% attenuation because there is nothing left to ferment. This is important because it can help predict the final gravity and alcohol content of a beer. A yeast with low attenuation will leave a beer with more sugar and more body than a yeast with high attenuation. This can also be very helpful when selecting a yeast strain for a recipe.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You should let the yeast know what it is to ferment. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a living thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ndash; Yves Benoit, head brewmaster at Brouwerij De Brabandere&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Fermentability of a wort is based on much more than temperature of the mash. The composition of the grist (e.g. total diastatic power) can have a much bigger effect than temperature alone. Unfermentable sugars have the greatest impact on your attenuation than any other factors. You can turn a dry stout into a sweet one by adding just lactose. Usually, the more the non-fermentables in the mash (crystal malt, partially kilned malt, etc), the lower the attenuation. Manipulating temperatures is a tool for overcoming the limitations of the grist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Brewing_with_Wheat.html?id=jc2QAwAAQBAJ">&lt;em>Brewing with Wheat&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, Stan Hieronymus mentions how brewers change their mash profile for each batch of grain, knowing that while it all may be wheat, the wheat from one particular farmer is different than the wheat from another. This is exactly like baking bread with different wheat varieties from different farms!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 3: inoculate with yeast&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let the scald cool off gradually to ~75¬∞F. Add &lt;strong>2.5g of WLP001&lt;/strong> (~100 drops); stir vigorously and mix thoroughly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ferment at &lt;strong>70¬∞F-73¬∞F&lt;/strong> (high end of WLP001&amp;rsquo;s recommended temperature range of 64¬∞F-73¬∞F) to bring out the yeast&amp;rsquo;s character. After &lt;strong>12 hours&lt;/strong>, the barm doubled in volume and started to fall and pull away from the sides of the bowl. It was ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Given the liquid yeast contains about 2.5 billion cells per mL and 2.5g has roughly 6.25 billion cells, the inoculation rate in the barm is about 16 million cells per gram.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite lower inoculation, I could tell the yeast was having much more fun in this saccharified scald loaded with nutrients than in the previous &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-1-1/">straight poolish&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mr. J. Meikle was certainly spot on:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The mixing process is the same as the &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-1-1/">straight poolish verison&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I let the dough ferment at &lt;strong>70-73¬∞F&lt;/strong> for &lt;strong>8 hours&lt;/strong>, followed by another &lt;strong>14 hours&lt;/strong> at &lt;strong>60-63¬∞F&lt;/strong>. The dough had nearly doubled in volume after 22 hours. That&amp;rsquo;s when I baked it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just tipped the dough out onto a baking sheet; no shaping or slashing. I baked it at 350¬∞F for 25 minutes.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Again, the bread smelled like buttery biscuits and toasted crackers during baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bread felt much lighter in my hand than the &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-1-1/">poolish version&lt;/a>. The crumb turned out more like my usual sourdough &lt;em>pan de cristal&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; airy and open, with bigger, more irregular holes.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Mr. J. Meikle was spot on again:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The barm has the strength, without the &amp;ldquo;rampness,&amp;rdquo; of compound, and the mildness without the weakness of Virgin.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The bread had a springy and chewy texture, and a nutty, slightly salty flavor that&amp;rsquo;s noticeably more complex than the &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-1-1/">straight poolish verison&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tasted the same &lt;strong>clean, robust wheat flavor&lt;/strong> without a trace of tanginess, like eating Triscuit¬Æ Original whole wheat crackers (America&amp;rsquo;s favorite shredded wheat snacks), the opposite of sourdough breads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever tasted a bread with such a dominating wheat flavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="WLP001 whole-wheat barm bread"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>WLP001 whole-wheat barm bread, sliced.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Just like how WLP001 accentuates hop flavors in beers, I think the yeast accentuates wheat flavors in breads. The flavor of Turkey Red seems 5x-10x amplified in this WLP001 bread than in any of my sourdough breads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The closest beer comparison I could think of is probably &lt;a href="https://www.anchorbrewing.com/blog/american-wheat-beers-heritage-and-history/">&lt;strong>American wheat beer&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, something like &lt;a href="https://www.anchorbrewing.com/beer/summer_beer">Anchor Brewing&amp;rsquo;s Summer¬Æ Wheat&lt;/a>, the first American wheat beer brewed since Prohibition and released in the summer of 1984: medium-bodied, wheat-emphatic, clean and balanced; a smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Adding 2% salt to the final dough was a good idea &amp;ndash; the extra salt opened up the taste buds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bread tasted great with a sharp cheddar and good mustard like Alstertor beer mustard, which IMO is the Charlize Theron of mustards: smooth, but not without an edge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s nothing like sitting down at the end of a day with a glass of your own fresh ale and a loaf of fresh homemade bread. The only thing to add might be homemade cheese or prosciutto!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;code>Note&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t think retarding beer yeast doughs at lower temperatures, as you would with sourdough breads, contributes much in terms of flavor or texture. It only makes scheduling easier.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>How is this barm related to the adjective &lt;em>barmy&lt;/em>? When it first emerged in the language in the early 1500s, the adjective &lt;em>barmy&lt;/em> meant precisely that: full of froth, foam, or barm. But before long a figurative meaning had developed, so that by the early 17th century people who were just as excitably lively or as bubbly as a pint of beer&amp;rsquo;s foaming barm were being described in equivalent terms. From there, the more recent use of barmy to mean &amp;ldquo;unhinged&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;deranged&amp;rdquo;, or generally &amp;ldquo;not thinking straight&amp;rdquo; emerged &amp;ndash; the latter of which, at least, could always be blamed on consuming a bit too much barm.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

While many people were driven to drink more during the Covid lockdown, I went the other way. I do have tanks of Russian &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvass">kvass&lt;/a>&lt;/em> and Romanian &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bor%C8%99_(bran)">bor»ô&lt;/a>&lt;/em> brewing in house all the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For some time now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by the centuries-old relationship between beer and bread &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely gripping, and the more I learn, the more gripping it gets. Today, for instance, I was learning about the old, strong relationship in Europe between bakers and brewers. Ages ago, breweries and bakeries lived side-by-side harmoniously. Brewers happily went about their noble work &amp;ndash; mashing, sparging, and fermenting. One blessed by-product of the brewing process was a foam that formed frothily on top of the fermenting liquor. The dusty baker next door would welcome consignments of this malty foam &amp;ndash; known as &amp;ldquo;barm&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and utilize the natural yeasts in it to leaven his dough. It made perfect sense, and as historical records have shown, ale and bread were the staple diet in the old days.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;As we brew, so we bake.&amp;rdquo; - an old adage&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Previously, I had thought that before commercial yeasts were developed, all bakers used sourdough to make their bread. Nope! Up until the 19th century, village bakers either depended on village brewers for their yeast (&amp;ldquo;barm&amp;rdquo;) in order to leaven their bread, or they literally brewed up their own &amp;ldquo;barm&amp;rdquo; for baking.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Andreas Krennmair&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em>Vienna Lager&lt;/em>, has an interesting take on how the relationship between brewers and bakers changed in the 19th century when brewers switched from ales to lagers:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Industrialisation had a profound effect on other breweries in and around Vienna: because of the quick success of Anton Dreher&amp;rsquo;s beer and brewing methods, all other breweries switched to bottom fermentation just within a few years. This rapid change had an unintended implication for another craft that had previously been reliant on breweries: baking. In the centuries before, bakers had been reliant on fresh beer yeast, which brewers always had available in abundance. When brewers started switching to bottom fermentation, the yeast given to bakers also changed its properties: &amp;hellip;the yeast suddenly contained hop bittering compounds and hop resins that turned these yeast darker and bitter-tasting, making it unsuitable for baking. &amp;hellip;so the Viennese baker&amp;rsquo;s guild announced in 1845 that they would award a prize to the person who could produce a leaven that was suitable to replace the much sought-after top-fermenting beer yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Coincidentally, the 1800s were the golden age of the hop industry; hop acreage reached its peak in 1878.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the end of the century, yeast specifically cultivated for breadmaking had become commercially available in blocks, and later in dry, granulated forms. Slowly &amp;ndash; and sadly &amp;ndash; the close bond between breweries and bakeries faded away.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.toastale.com/">Toast Ale&lt;/a>, a London-based craft brewery, makes beer from waste bread. In the &lt;a href="https://www.willhawkes.net/blog/2023/3/20/march2023newsletter">March 2023 edition&lt;/a> of Will Hawkes&amp;rsquo;s newsletter &lt;em>London Beer City&lt;/em>, Toast&amp;rsquo;s founder talked about the company&amp;rsquo;s funding (some from Heineken), marketing strategy (&amp;ldquo;buyer personas&amp;rdquo;) and business model:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>While the impact of bread on the flavour of the beer is limited (typically, bread replaces 25 percent of the malted barley), I‚Äôve always thought the implied message of Toast, that you can make great beer out of old bread, was a difficult one for the brewing industry. What happened to the ‚Äòfinest malt and hops‚Äô?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;those who drink Toast‚Äôs beers are at ease with the idea of surplus bread being used to make it. In common with most people, I suspect, they don‚Äôt really care about malt and hops. They just want something nice to drink.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The idea of making bread with breweries' by-products has intrigued me for a long time. I&amp;rsquo;ve baked and enjoyed &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/breadford-von-regrainton/">breads infused with brewer&amp;rsquo;s spent grains&lt;/a>, as well as ones leavened with &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/yeast-water/">wild yeasts captured from fruits&lt;/a>. But how about baking bread with brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="bakers-yeast-vs-brewers-yeast">baker&amp;rsquo;s yeast vs. brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the mid-19th century, when bakers ditched breweries' barms &lt;em>en masse&lt;/em> and started looking for new sources of yeast, for a few years a new trade of &amp;ldquo;barm-brewers&amp;rdquo; sprang up who specialized in propagating yeast for bakers.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This in turn was displaced by the introduction of compressed blocks of yeast known as &amp;ldquo;fresh yeast&amp;rdquo; today. As &lt;a href="https://dafteejit.com/2020/03/the-history-of-modern-baking-yeast/">Andreas Krennmair writes&lt;/a>, the process of making compressed yeast was invented by a brewer, who used brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast. This has inspired Lars Marius Garshol to ponder, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.garshol.priv.no/blog/411.html">Does bread yeast exist?&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, most forms of brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast and baker&amp;rsquo;s yeast currently on the market all come from the same species of yeast called &lt;em>&lt;code>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/code>&lt;/em>. The yeast derives its name from the Latinized Greek meaning &amp;ldquo;sugar fungus&amp;rdquo;, because it converts sugars into CO‚ÇÇ and ethanol during aerobic fermentation &amp;ndash; which makes beer alcoholic and inflates a lump of dough into a fluffy loaf of bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> strains share a common natural history. Some, through artificial selection, are better adapted for certain processes, while others have more than one use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the arrival of industrial yeasts, baker&amp;rsquo;s yeast used to be much more diverse, but what we call &amp;ldquo;bread yeast&amp;rdquo; today is simply particular strains of &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> monocultures that have been selected by yeast manufacturers primarily for their ability to rapidly metabolize wheat starch, produce large quantities of CO‚ÇÇ while fermenting the dough, and make bread light. The quick-rising yeast now available in stores is an improved strain developed using modern genetic methods. Professional bakers use commercial yeasts that produce a fast and strong rise and a clean taste (less flavor and depth) in the finished loaf of bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Modern bread yeast manufacturers narrowly focus their yeast development on two issues:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>gas production.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>speed of rising.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Variants are produced with these goals in mind, to suit different technical requirements of the baking industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, instant yeasts (aka. fast-rising, rapid-rise, quick-rise, and bread machine yeast), are manufactured to dissolve more quickly than active dry yeasts; they can be mixed directly into flour and other dry ingredients, without the need to &amp;ldquo;proof&amp;rdquo; the yeast in warm water first. Lesaffre, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest yeast producers, has formulated &lt;a href="https://lesaffre.ae/en/our-products/professional-products/saf-instant-gold-500g/">Saf-Instant¬Æ Gold dry yeast&lt;/a> specifically for sweet doughs (with &amp;gt;=5% sugar/weight of flour) like Hawaiian rolls and &lt;em>panettoni&lt;/em>, as well as &lt;a href="https://lesaffrebaking.com/product/saf-instant-red/">Saf-Instant¬Æ Red&lt;/a> that excels in sugarless doughs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A number of people claim that baker&amp;rsquo;s yeast brews good beers (since most bread yeasts are &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->phenolic&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A 2018 paper published in the &lt;em>Journal of the Institute of Brewing&lt;/em>, titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jib.503">evaluation of &lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em> strains isolated from non-brewing environments in beer production&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, tested 12 novel &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> strains isolated from grape must, bakery, wine, and apple stillage in the production of beer. The researchers found that&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The most suitable strain for beer production, based on fermentative ability and volatile profile, was a baker&amp;rsquo;s yeast&amp;hellip;. Interestingly, some esters were above the sensory threshold.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Another example: The Finnish farmhouse ale &lt;em>sahti&lt;/em> is fermented with baking strains, rather than &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->brewing strains&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, of &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em>. A 2020 paper, titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jib.608">sourdough derived strains of &lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em> and their potential for farmhouse ale brewing&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, concludes&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>sourdough isolates of &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> are suitable for &lt;em>sahti&lt;/em> production, but could also be applied to other beer styles as a way to differentiate products.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>However, I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard the other way round, i.e. brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast makes good bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Manufacturers of beer and wine yeasts all describe multiple varieties of yeasts, each producing a slightly differently flavored product. In the case of wine, some yeasts are tied to specific cultivars of grapes. The importance of yeast strains in producing different varieties of beer is illustrated by White Labs' assortment of beer yeasts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=169&amp;amp;type=YEAST">WLP566&lt;/a> Belgian Saison II Ale Yeast: &amp;ldquo;a moderate phenol producer with clove-like flavor and aromatic notes present in the finished beer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=174&amp;amp;type=YEAST">WLP590&lt;/a> French Saison Ale Yeast: &amp;ldquo;produces flavors and aromas of pear, apple and cracked pepper&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=267&amp;amp;type=YEAST">WLP077&lt;/a> Tropicale Yeast Blend: &amp;ldquo;a balance of tropical flavors and aromas, such as passionfruit, grapefruit, and mango&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be lovely to be able to make a bread that produces a &amp;ldquo;clove-like&amp;rdquo; aroma and flavor when it&amp;rsquo;s toasted? Or a loaf with a slight hint of smoky tomato that might make it ideal for &lt;em>bruschetta&lt;/em>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if breads in a bakery might, for the first time, be differentiated by subtleties of aroma? Imagine a boule with a hint of plum and thyme under an overtone of apple &amp;ndash; next to a boule made with the same recipe but a different yeast and thus yielding a hazelnut aroma.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Beer is, after all, liquid bread. Like brewers, I&amp;rsquo;m constantly on the lookout for special flours and yeasts to make that unique, satisfying loaf.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I keep thinking about experimenting with combinations of different yeast strains in a dough to see how they might enhance a bread&amp;rsquo;s flavor and aroma. The yeast monoculture practice be damned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does it take to make a good loaf of bread with brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast? Is it possible in the modern era? I want to find out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a vast catalog of yeast strains used by brewers and wine makers that I want to experiment with, and it&amp;rsquo;s never been easier to collaborate with people over the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="california-ale-yeast">California ale yeast&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The first craft beer yeast I decided to experiment is &lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=101&amp;amp;type=YEAST">WLP001&lt;/a> California Ale Yeast¬Æ, which is White Labs' OG yeast strain, first produced in 1995.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp;ldquo;Chico&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> strain (named after the &lt;em>ch√¢teaux&lt;/em> of Sierra Nevada Brewing Company) is probably the most widely used beer strain on the West Coast, if not in the entire country. It&amp;rsquo;s a driving force behind IPA 2.0, aka. the yeast that launched 1,000 beers.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>WLP001 is famous for its clean flavors and hardy fermentations and is known for its use in hoppy beers. It accentuates hop flavors and aromas and attenuates well, even for high-gravity beers. A higher-than-average attenuation leads to drier beers as well as medium flocculation to leave a clean and crisp beer. With a healthy pitch and yeast, WLP001 is also quick at reabsorbing diacetyl.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The yeast has a very beery aroma right out of the package.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A &amp;ldquo;clean-fermenting&amp;rdquo; strain with a neutral flavor and aroma profile (instead of a &amp;ldquo;fruity&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;estery&amp;rdquo; strain) would be an interesting baseline for comparisons with other yeasts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another reason for starting with WLP001 is that a clean fermenter showcases a brewer&amp;rsquo;s recipe formulation (e.g. choice of malts, hops, brewing temperatures, and fermentation temperatures) more than other strains. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve made &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/pan-de-cristal/">these kinds of breads&lt;/a> many times, it&amp;rsquo;d be fairly easy for me to tell how the ale yeast differs from sourdough.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="wlp001-poolish">WLP001 poolish&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Many researchers have reported that the dough fermentation by &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> promoted an increase in the contents of phenolic compounds due to the structural breakdown of cell wall, leading to the liberation of phenolic compounds and/or metabolization of phenolics by yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, thermal processing may have negative effects on these bioactive compounds, likely caused by oxidation, isomerization, and interaction with wheat proteins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One technical challenge of baking with yeast is making the yeast&amp;rsquo;s distinct character shine through.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe a poolish (a preferment with 25% of total flour) with super low yeast inoculation would help? A poolish particularly elevates the bread&amp;rsquo;s creamy, slightly nutty character and crisp, thin crust. (Yum.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I made a loose preferment that used roughly equal parts of whole wheat flour and water by weight with a tiny bit of California ale yeast &amp;ndash; and no salt.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>I mixed the whole wheat flour and water together in a &lt;strong>shallow, wide-open bowl&lt;/strong>. I prefer it to tall, narrow fermenters because high hydrostatic pressure and CO‚ÇÇ levels tend to inhibit ester formation.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I added ~100 drops of WLP001, which totaled ~2.5g. I whipped it vigorously into the mixture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>White Labs' homebrew yeasts typically have a concentration of &amp;gt;=100 billion cells per 40 mL, i.e. 2.5 billion cells per mL. Assume 2.5g of the liquid yeast contains roughly 6.25 billion cells, the inoculation rate in the poolish is about 22-23 million cells per gram.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>These [West Coast] yeasts have a potential ester profile. If you play with fermentation temperature, you can really influence the character of the beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Richard Norgrove, Bear Republic Brewing Company (Healdsburg, California)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>WLP001 has a fermentation temperature range of 64¬∞F-73¬∞F. I loosely covered up the poolish (leaving an air gap) and let it ferment at the high side of the recommended temperatures (&lt;strong>70¬∞F-73¬∞F&lt;/strong>), in order to bring out the yeast&amp;rsquo;s character. I checked on it every few hours and gave it a stir to aerate the mixture.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I provided WLP001 all the time it needed to propagate, and let the poolish tell me when it was done. It ended up going for &lt;strong>48 hours&lt;/strong>. This was to ensure vigorous and complete fermentation before the poolish was mixed into the final dough.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Clean strains usually ferment more slowly than fruitier strains and flocculate at a medium rate, remaining in suspension long enough to condition the beer properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When ripe, the poolish doubled in volume. It was brimming with almost uniform micro-bubbles, instead of the bigger, more irregular bubbles you get with sourdough or bread yeast.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Upon initial mixing, the mixture had a mild toasty wheat aroma from freshly milled Turkey Red wheat. The toasty wheat aroma was replaced by a slight yeasty twang after 12 hours, so I assume that&amp;rsquo;s when the yeast started working. After 48 hours, the yeasty aroma was completely gone. The smell was very clean &amp;ndash; maybe with a hint of fresh beer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A quick search on home-brewing forums show that &lt;a href="https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/wlp001-peach-flavor.211921/">peach esters&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/wlp001-flocculation-and-clearing.242072/">slow flocculation&lt;/a> seem to be the two major complaints people have with WLP001.

&lt;p>A phenol is a hydroxylated aromatic ring, a compound with a 6-membered carbon ring bonded directly to a hydroxyl group (-OH). These are the same class of compounds used in some antiseptics, and some consumers describe their flavor and aroma as medicinal. The health benefits of phenolic acids are primarily due to their antioxidant properties, but these acids also show anti-ulcer, anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, anti-microbial, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective and neuroprotective activities.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ale strains of &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> are &amp;ldquo;top-fermenting&amp;rdquo; (I prefer &amp;ldquo;top-harvesting&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;warmish-fermenting&amp;rdquo; for clearer communication) yeasts. They are relatively hydrophobic, such that upon flocculating or clumping together, they tend to connect to the CO‚ÇÇ produced and float to the surface of the fermenter contents. As a result, brewers were able to collect the yeast and create more colonies for future beers. On the other hand, lagers are made with &lt;em>S. pastorianus&lt;/em> strains, which are &amp;ldquo;bottom-fermenting&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;bottom-harvesting&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cold-fermenting&amp;rdquo;, to be more specific) and widely thought to have originated from a natural hybridization event that occurred between a &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> strain and a non-&lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> strain, probably a &lt;em>S. bayanus&lt;/em> strain. From this perspective, ales are considered closer to the ancient beer type than lagers.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

The pair&amp;rsquo;s first beer release was the famed Pale Ale, the beer that proved beers with an aggressively hopped backbone could be successful. Although labeled as a pale ale, it was really the &amp;ldquo;OG IPA&amp;rdquo; as it highlighted hops that no other beers had done before.

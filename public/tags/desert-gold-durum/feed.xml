&lt;p>The West begins where the average annual rainfall drops below twenty inches.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Bernard DeVoto&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The Imperial Valley in southern California is often cited as a great example of modern desert agriculture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, the Imperial Valley is a place of jarring contrasts. Half of the valley remains in its natural state, aka. a bone-dry desert with some breathtaking sand dunes; the other half exemplifies a modern engineering marvel &amp;ndash; mile after mile of green fields lined by irrigation canals and sometimes shrouded by showers of water from sprinklers.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Imperial Valley is one of the oldest farming communities in the Colorado River basin. It lies in the Colorado Desert section of the Sonoran Desert, with overwhelming heat and meager average rainfall (about 3&amp;quot; or 76 mm per year). Dirt was carried here over millions of years by the Colorado River, as it carved the Grand Canyon ever deeper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to irrigation &amp;ndash; that is, thanks to the US Bureau of Reclamation &amp;ndash; states such as California, Arizona, and Idaho became populous and wealthy; millions settled in regions where nature, left alone, would have countenanced thousands at best; great valleys and hemispherical basins metamorphosed from desert blonde to semi-tropical green.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Agriculture is the economic backbone of the Imperial Valley due to irrigation, which is supplied entirely from the Colorado River via the All-American Canal. Thousands of acres of prime farmland have transformed the desert into one of the most productive farming regions in California with an annual crop production of over $1 billion. Evidently, agriculture accounts for nearly half of all local employment.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Unlike the Central Valley in the north which draws its water from rain and snow in the Sierra Mountains or pumps it from shrinking underground aquifers, the Imperial Valley has only one source of water: the Colorado River, 80 miles to the east.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most basic principle governing water use in the western US is &amp;ldquo;first in time, first in right.&amp;rdquo; These lush fields in the Imperial Valley owe their existence to fortune-seeking land speculators and engineers who arrived early and, starting in 1901, dug the first canal to ship water here from the Colorado River. (Prior to the 20th century, this patch was mostly unsettled.) Since most of the Imperial Valley actually lies below sea level &amp;ndash; and well below the canal&amp;rsquo;s starting point on the Colorado River near Yuma, Arizona &amp;ndash; water is able to flow there by gravity alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to the stunning wealth that irrigation farming had produced, California came rolling out of the 1920s like Jay Gatsby in his alabaster phaeton. Agriculture was California; there were no sprawling defense and aerospace industries, no Silicon Valley.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Salton Sea was an unfortunate consequence of the engineering failure that marked the construction of the original canal. The current canal, built during the New Deal and named the &lt;a href="https://www.iid.com/water/water-transportation-system/colorado-river-facilities/all-american-canal">All-American Canal&lt;/a>, began delivering water to the Imperial Valley in 1940; two years later, it became the sole water source for Imperial Valley&amp;rsquo;s residents and farmlands.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Water delivered to the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) each year by the All-American Canal &amp;ndash; through a vast system of canals, dams, and pipelines &amp;ndash; is enough to cover the entire irrigated land, roughly 500,000 acres, with 5 feet of water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imported water and a long growing season allow two crop cycles each year; the Imperial Valley now supplies over 2/3 of winter fruits and vegetables, cotton, and grain for domestic and international markets. The valley also produces most of the lamb and sheep in the US. (This raises a bunch of uncomfortable questions: What&amp;rsquo;s the rest of America doing? Why is the whole nation dependent on a few hundred farms concentrated in an irrigated desert for its food? How did this situation come to be? What happened to Eliot Coleman&amp;rsquo;s four-season farming revolution? &amp;hellip; )&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Alfalfa is the king crop produced in the Imperial Valley. 1 out of every 3 farmed acres in the valley is dedicated to growing alfalfa, which dries into a high-protein hay commonly used as food for livestock. It&amp;rsquo;s also one of the thirstiest drop; its deep roots sucking up water in a region scorched by a 22-year drought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another contradiction of California: How does irrigating alfalfa in 120¬∞F temperatures in the dead of July make any sense at all?&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYBZISNYk8I" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The Imperial Valley&amp;rsquo;s alfalfa industry is not only one of the largest water users in the basin, but also one of the most powerful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Large-scale production of water-gorging, low-value crops like alfalfa during a megadrought is possible only because the Imperial Valley is the single biggest controller of rights to Colorado River water and the IID farmers have access to cheap (subsidized) water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to these massive irrigation projects, south of the canal, the Colorado River no longer flows above ground at all for much of the year into Mexico.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Colorado River, which supplies freshwater to more than 40 million people in the southwestern US and northern Mexico, has been in rapid decline. Reduced snowpack, drought conditions and higher average temperatures have all reduced the river&amp;rsquo;s flow in recent decades. The two biggest reservoirs along the river, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are each creeping towards a &amp;ldquo;dead pool,&amp;rdquo; an ominous sign that the Colorado River could stop flowing entirely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Agriculture accounts for ~80% of total water consumption in the Colorado River basin, with roughly half of that going towards the production of alfalfa hay, according to a 2020 &lt;a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/323061602.pdf">study&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-pygL1-yzM" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>What has all this irrigation amounted to?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Massive industrial storehouses line the area, packed with thousands upon thousands of stacks of alfalfa bales ready to be fed to dairy cows &amp;ndash; but not cows in California&amp;rsquo;s Central Valley or Montana&amp;rsquo;s rangelands. Instead, the alfalfa will be fed to cows across the Pacific &amp;ndash; in China, Japan and Korea, and farther away in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, etc. An increasing percentage of the alfalfa produced here is exported.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Growers say the reasons boil down to simple economics. The market for alfalfa hay in southern California has shrunk over the years as dairies have closed or moved elsewhere, while demand for dairy products has grown exponentially in other parts of the world. Meanwhile, it costs little to freight goods on the back haul to China, because the US runs a persistently high trade deficit with China; containers from Asia arrive full but often return empty. Some claim it&amp;rsquo;s actually cheaper to ship hay to China than to haul the same load by truck to dairy farms 400 miles north in the San Joaquin Valley.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brokers regularly fly in from overseas, some staying at a local golf course and country club. Chinese buyers are wined and dined across the border in Mexicali, which has a long-established Chinese community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to a 2015 &lt;a href="https://pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CA-Ag-Water-Use.pdf">analysis&lt;/a> by the Pacific Institute, alfalfa production in California uses around 5 acre-feet (6,167 cubic meters) of water. In comparison, sugar beets use roughly 3 acre-feet (3,700 cubic meters), and grains as little as 1 acre-foot (1,233 cubic meters).&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EE4uMOtqIc8" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The top water-using activity in California is growing alfalfa. Farmers in Imperial County currently draw more water from the Colorado River than all of Arizona and Nevada combined. An alfalfa farmer can grow alfalfa 10-12 times a year and sell it for $260-$280/ton. These are not the hardworking family farmers of yesteryear. They are giant agribusiness corporations pulling in $1.8 billion from selling 7 million tons of alfalfa every year in California, according to a University of California, Davis study by Daniel Geisseler and William R. Horwath.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This business has been extremely profitable because alfalfa farmers get 3.4 million acre-feet (1 acre foot =325,851 gallons) of water every year for only $35-$60 per acre-foot. The water you get for your house costs you $800 per acre-foot today, and it could be double that in 10 years' time. You could supply the water needs of 40 million people with that 3.4 million acre-feet. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that enough water for greater Los Angeles is being used to raise irrigated pasture for livestock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feeding irrigated grass to cows is as wasteful a use of water as you can conceive. Pasture is hydrologically inefficient in the extreme, and, metabolically speaking, so are cows: You need 7-8 feet of water in the hot deserts to keep grass alive, which means that you need ~50,000 pounds of water to raise 1 pound of cow. (Feeding alfalfa to cows requires even more water, but at least alfalfa fixes nitrogen in the soil.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the livestock industry earned California any real money, and if cows (unlike avocados or artichokes) couldn&amp;rsquo;t be raised on rainfall in 35 other states, then giving more water to cows than to humans in the nation&amp;rsquo;s richest and most populous state &amp;ndash; a semi-desert state at the mercy of a precarious water supply &amp;ndash; might make a grain or two of sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>During the last few years, companies from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have established farming operations on thousands of acres around the Imperial Valley and the adjacent Palo Verde Valley.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Saudi Arabian companies are pumping up groundwater from beneath land they have purchased and are using it to grow alfalfa for export to the Middle East. They have no plan for replacing this scarce and finite groundwater that accumulated over thousands of years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a matter of fact, foreign corporations have increased purchases of farmland in the US, particularly in the southwest where longstanding laws on water rights give land owners unlimited access to the valuable water underneath the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why don&amp;rsquo;t they grow their own alfalfa? Because they are short of water and it&amp;rsquo;s so much cheaper to buy from the US.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Growing water-intensive crops in the US and exporting them to water-scarce countries is a form of geo-economic arbitrage, a natural consequence of the globalization of everything. Essentially, water is exported out of the US in the form of crops like alfalfa, rice, or almonds. Guess who is currently one of the largest net exporters of virtual water in the world?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This trend has been accelerating for decades, despite concerns that this &amp;ldquo;virtual water trading&amp;rdquo; is unsustainable in the long term, especially in drought-plagued areas such as California. If California is &lt;em>really&lt;/em> short of water, why are we shipping it to Asia?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What this means is, ultimately, the US is not in control of its own farmland &amp;ndash; or food production.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPEN0o5pbA4" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Some argue the Imperial Valley is doing good by growing food and feeding the country, and point the finger at some desert metropolises such as Las Vegas, which boasts some 50 million visitors each year and wastes way more &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-01-29/colorado-river-in-crisis-cracking-down-on-grass">water from Colorado River&lt;/a> with its gushing fountains. The truth is, Las Vegas and Reno represent 95% of Nevada&amp;rsquo;s economy but use 10% of its water &amp;ndash; alfalfa growers use most of the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Water overuse is a prisoner&amp;rsquo;s dilemma and a tragedy of the commons. If free-market mechanisms &amp;ndash; which much of western ag publicly applauds and privately abhors &amp;ndash; were actually allowed to work, the West&amp;rsquo;s water &amp;ldquo;shortage&amp;rdquo; would be exposed for what it is: the sort of shortage you expect when inexhaustible demand chases an almost free good. (If someone were selling Porsches for $3,000 apiece, there would be a shortage of those, too.) California has a shortage of water because it has a surfeit of cows &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s really almost as simple as that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If history is any guide, the odds that we can sustain a &amp;ldquo;civilization&amp;rdquo; in deserts would have to be regarded as low. Only one desert civilization, out of dozens that grew up in antiquity, has survived uninterrupted into modern times. And Egypt&amp;rsquo;s approach to irrigation was fundamentally different from all the rest.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="pane-ricco">pane ricco&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It just struck me that I should make a &lt;em>pane ricco&lt;/em> (rich bread). I named it as such because in the western US, it&amp;rsquo;s often said that water flows uphill toward money. And it literally does. Water leaps 3,000 feet across the Tehachapi Mountains in gigantic siphons to slay the thirst of Los Angeles, as it&amp;rsquo;s shoved 1,000 feet out of Colorado River canyons to hydrate Phoenix and Palm Springs and the irrigated lands around them. Water is wealth in the West.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A few years ago I drove through Tucson, Arizona with a friend. We stopped by an unbelievably highly rated artisan bakery in town and tried a few different kinds of their bread (some loaves contained a small percentage of locally grown &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/white-sonora/">White Sonora&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/desert-gold-durum/">Desert Durum&lt;/a>). Each single one of these breads we got tasted like burnt toast. A big question mark popped into my head: Do professional bakers not know that they can score bread with beautiful designs &lt;em>without&lt;/em> burning it and making it so bitter, so hard to bite through the crust, and so tough to eat? I was more than disappointed because of all the hype. Literally every loaf needed to come out 10 minutes sooner. Luckily, the interior was decent enough to be edible; not great, still better than all the other bakeries in Tucson combined, which says a lot about bread culture in Tucson &amp;ndash; heck, city is better known for flour tortillas than levain. I swore next time I&amp;rsquo;d skip Tucson and check out some &lt;em>panader√≠as&lt;/em> in Sonora, Mexico instead. &amp;ldquo;Artisan&amp;rdquo; is one of the most used/abused words today; it just means &amp;ldquo;we are new to this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We kept on going along I-8 E towards San Diego. Soon after we crossed the Arizona-California state border, we passed the Imperial Valley, a sprawling patch in the Sonoran Desert, hemmed in by the Salton Sea to the north and Mexico to the south.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I probably would haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about the place again if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the Desert Durum¬Æ wheat.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Today the Imperial Valley produces more than half of the durum in California. Durum used to grown mainly in Siskiyou and Modoc Counties in the northernmost part of the state, until a few decades ago, when durum production moved to the southernmost part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Durum (&lt;em>Triticum turgidum, spp. Durum&lt;/em>) is an ancient variety of hard red spring wheat, a close relative of ancient emmer that is exceptionally hard &amp;ndash; hence the name &amp;ldquo;durum,&amp;rdquo; which is Latin for &amp;ldquo;hard,&amp;rdquo; and the species is the hardest of all wheats. As such, it requires significant force to mill into sandy-textured, golden-colored semolina for pasta and more finely ground durum flour for breads and pastries. Coupled with a high protein content (typically &amp;gt;12%), durum is a miller&amp;rsquo;s delight (or challenge).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Durum is genetically less evolved than the modern bread wheat (&lt;em>Triticum aestivum&lt;/em>), but stands out among other wheat varieties with its unique characteristics. Most of the durum grown today is amber durum; the grains are larger than other types of wheat berries, and have a beautiful amber color due to the extra carotenoid pigments (the naturally occurring compounds that give red, orange, and yellow vegetables their vibrant color), which also contribute to its distinct flavor that can be described as nuttier and slightly sweeter than modern wheat.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="Desert Gold durum wheat berries"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Desert Gold durum wheat berries, from the Imperial Valley of California. Durum wheat berries are the source of the semolina flour used to make one of the food staples of the world &amp;ndash; pasta &amp;ndash; as well as other traditional delicacies such as couscous and bulgur.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Durum has a yellow endosperm, which gives pasta its distinct color. When durum is initially milled, the endosperm is ground into a granular product called &lt;em>semolina&lt;/em>, which has a texture more like cornmeal and is ideal for pasta. Typically, the endosperm is separated from the bran and germ of the grain; only the endosperm is milled. It&amp;rsquo;s also possible to keep all the components, resulting in a wholegrain durum semolina.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have ever tried making Jeff Hamelman&amp;rsquo;s durum bread from his &lt;em>Bread&lt;/em>, you may have tripped over &amp;ldquo;durum flour.&amp;rdquo; This usually refers to very finely milled durum flour, aka. &lt;em>semola rimacinata&lt;/em> (remilled semolina, sometimes labeled &amp;ldquo;extra fancy&amp;rdquo; durum flour). After separating coarse durum midds, the semolina flour is re-milled several times until it resembles a fine powder. It&amp;rsquo;s the finest grind possible for durum and has the palest color, though it still looks yellow due to durum&amp;rsquo;s high carotenoid pigment concentration. Durum flour is great for softer-type noodles and some types of artisan bread that don&amp;rsquo;t require the elasticity of a high-rising flour. Again, durum flour can either be refined or wholegrain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite its relatively high protein content, durum&amp;rsquo;s gluten quality is different from that of modern bread wheat. While it forms a relatively stretchy dough, the dough structure tends to be fragile and weak, easily breaking down if mixed too much or fermented for too long. As such, breads made with mostly semolina or durum flours tend to have a dense and chewy texture. In some parts of the world, such as Altamura, Italy, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->durum breads&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> are beloved for that specific texture as well as distinct flavor.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>So why is durum so prized for pasta-making?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Texture&lt;/strong>: The main reason is the gluten in durum is strong but not particularly elastic, which means pasta made from this type of flour will keep its shape and the cherished &lt;em>al dente&lt;/em> texture after cooking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Taste&lt;/strong>: Durum has a delicious nutty flavor with an earthy aroma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Aesthetics&lt;/strong>: Durum has a rich golden color, which naturally evokes a happy feeling about the quality of the pasta and meals made with it. High-quality pasta awakens all the senses &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s an immersive experience to be savored.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>California is recognized for growing the best durum in the world. California durum varieties tend to have high yellow pigment, high gluten strength, and make a perfect &lt;em>al dente&lt;/em> whole-wheat pasta.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have ever enjoyed Barilla pasta in your favorite Italian dish, you have most likely consumed Desert Durum¬Æ wheat from Imperial County, CA. The Imperial Valley is the main location for the production of the Desert Durum¬Æ, a special type of durum with excellent quality that is highly demanded by various local and international pasta makers like Barilla Pasta. The success of the Desert Durum¬Æ wheat is owed to the hard work of UC-Davis professor and researcher, Jorge Dubcovsky.&lt;/p>

alt="Desert Gold durum ravioli sauced"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>handmade wholegrain Desert Gold durum sourdough ravioli, cooked and served with creamy sun-dried tomato sauce, shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano, and fresh basil&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Desert Gold is a Desert Durum¬Æ variety with high-yield potential and excellent pasta quality; it&amp;rsquo;s also well adapted to the San Joaquin Valley and the Imperial Valley of California. It&amp;rsquo;s very similar to Desert King, but has two genes for improved yellow pigment in pasta and one gene for reduced grain cadmium content (a beneficial human health trait).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be labeled as Desert Durum¬Æ commercially, the grain must be at least 90% produced under irrigation in the desert valleys and lowland of Arizona or California. These are areas of high temperatures (May-June temperatures average 90¬∞F) and low rainfall (annual precipitation averages less than 200 mm). Desert Durum¬Æ is planted November through February and harvested in May and June.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="milling">milling&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Most of the durum produced (under irrigation) in the desert valleys and lowlands of Arizona and California are rated &lt;strong>No. 1 Hard Amber Durum (HAD)&lt;/strong>, a subclass of durum under the Official US Standards for Grain. HAD has &amp;gt;=75% hard, vitreous kernels of amber color, and sets the &amp;ldquo;gold standard&amp;rdquo; for premium pasta, couscous, etc.&lt;/p>

alt="Desert Gold durum vs. Joaquin Oro"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Desert Gold durum (left) vs. Joaquin Oro (right), both grown in California.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The vitreousness of durum wheat has traditionally been regarded by the wheat industry worldwide as an important quality factor. The average vitreous kernel content (HVAC) of Desert Durum¬Æ is &amp;gt;=90%. When compared to non-vitreous (starchy and piebald) kernels, vitreous kernels generally have improved cooking quality, better pasta color, coarser granulation, and higher protein content &amp;ndash; and thus sell at a premium. That comes with a string attached, of course: The glassy and translucent vitreous kernels are significantly harder to mill than the opaque starchy kernels, which are as hard as common bread wheats. (Piebald kernels are intermediate in protein content, but comparable in hardness to vitreous kernels.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never milled durum before, but I&amp;rsquo;ve often heard that durum milling is a complex procedure involving repetitive grinding and sieving, in order to obtain maximal semolina yield and the least amount of bran powder. Since the durum endosperm is extremely hard and vitreous, millers usually peel or pearl the kernels first to remove the outer layers of bran, to help improve the efficiency of durum processing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These Desert Gold durum berries shared by friends at the California Wheat Commission were super easy to mill. I ran them through a countertop electric WonderMill only once (on Bread Flour setting), and it turned out fine enough for my use.&lt;/p>

alt="Desert Gold durum flour"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Freshly milled Desert Gold durum, unsifted. It smells nutty and toasty, like roasted chickpeas!&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I guess this first grind would be called &lt;em>semola di grano duro integrale&lt;/em> in Italy. The texture is somewhat gritty, less coarse than typical semolina but not as fine as flour. It has an amber yellow color and contains every part of the grain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OMG, freshly milled Desert Gold durum has such an intoxicating aroma, reminiscent of roasted chickpeas!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pane-nero">&lt;em>pane nero&lt;/em>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is my first durum bake in a looooong time. I made a loaf of 100% semolina sourdough bread ~3 years ago, and used semolina (&lt;em>rava&lt;/em>/&lt;em>suji&lt;/em>) from an Indian grocery store. That experiment gave me a good idea of how durum/semolina would behave in a bread dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time, I set my sight on delving into the flavorful versatility of durum. I would like to find out what makes whole durum wheat tick from both a milling and baking standpoint and how I might incorporate it into my freshly milled wholegrain repertoire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get the best flavor out of durum, you have to to push the limits. In my experience with durum, a long autolyse helps develop the dough; a ripe levain makes a better bread; after which, all it needs is a quick shape and bake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The conventional rules of thumb for baking with durum/semolina is 1) low hydration and 2) gentle mixing. For example, &lt;em>pane di Altamura&lt;/em> usually comes in at 65%-70% hydration and &lt;em>pane di Matera&lt;/em> at 70%-80%.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly keen on sticking to tried-and-true methods. I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and bake my interpretation of &lt;em>pane nero&lt;/em> (black bread from Sicily).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this bread:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>total Desert Gold durum milled: &lt;strong>400g&lt;/strong> (100%)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>total hydration: &lt;strong>560g&lt;/strong> (140%)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Using the same fine-mesh sieve that I used to bolt Turkey Red, I bolted 400g freshly milled wholegrain durum flour into&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>360g flour (90% extraction)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>40g coarse bits (10%)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s pretty high extraction for the first run through the mill.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="semolina-porridge">semolina porridge&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Given that the bran of the durum wheat kernel is actually thinner than most hard wheats &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s the starchy endosperm that&amp;rsquo;s actually the hardest to shatter &amp;ndash; the bigger pieces in wholegrain durum flour don&amp;rsquo;t always end up being mostly bran.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pre-cooking the coarse pieces will help bring out the wonderful flavors and nutrition benefits of the bran and the germ &amp;ndash; aromatic oils, minerals, and fiber, to name a few.&lt;/p>

&lt;td>300%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>120g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Process:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Toast the dry semolina mix in a 300¬∞F oven (or in a skillet on the stovetop) for 3-4 minutes, until a slight toasty aroma hits your nose. This step is optional but will enhance the flavor enormously. Just be careful not to go overboard &amp;ndash; it will burn in a flash.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Put the toasties in a small pot and pour in milk; bring to a full boil, whisking frequently.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Reduce heat and simmer until a thick, creamy consistency. Turn off heat and let it cool off.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The semolina mix cooks fast &amp;ndash; the whole thing takes 10-15 minutes tops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You can make this in a microwave, too, just make sure to pause and stir frequently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any kind of milk will work. You can use plain water, too.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The porridge will also improve the texture of the baked bread through a process called &lt;em>starch gelatinization&lt;/em>, where starch and water meet heat, causing the starch molecules to swell. As a result, the water is gradually absorbed in an irreversible manner (&amp;ldquo;locked in&amp;rdquo;). This turns the mixture into a viscous and transparent gel, which is then used in sauces, puddings, creams and other food products to provide a pleasing texture. One of the most recognizable Chinese &lt;em>dim sum&lt;/em> delicacies, &lt;a href="https://tasteasianfood.com/har-gow/">&lt;em>har gow&lt;/em>&lt;/a> (shrimp dumplings), utilizes this technique to create an ultra-thin, translucent, and chewy skin. (The most common example to explain this phenomenon is pasta preparation: Pasta is made ‚Äã‚Äãmostly of semolina that contains high amounts of starch; when it&amp;rsquo;s cooked in boiling water, the size increases because it absorbs water and gets a soft texture.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I also toasted 1/2 of the black sesame seeds, leaving the other 1/2 raw for coating the dough.&lt;/p>

alt="Desert Gold durum dough"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Desert Gold wholegrain durum dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Process:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Autolyse&lt;/strong> @ ~70% hydration: Combine the flour with 252g water; mix until a shaggy mass; let autolyze for 6-8 hours (or overnight) in the fridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Levain&lt;/strong>: Squeeze the levain into the dough; mix until combined; let rest for 10-20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Double hydration&lt;/strong>: Add 100g or 2/3 of the remaining water gradually, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgz0oAhgwyg">Rubaud-mixing&lt;/a> (lifting, stretching, and dropping) until thoroughly absorbed. This requires a bit patience, so take your time. If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I&amp;rsquo;m good at, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>bassinage&lt;/em>. And I usually put on some &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlQWGGham__4sBxnwVyKbM8n91Xb9vwUG">music&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkB8eF4ATHl4Jm1BeCZgQ9A">podcasts&lt;/a> while I do this. Hand-mixing a dough is a type of alternative physical therapy; I find it tremendously therapeutic and cathartic. Gorging the dough with soooo much water feels like a crime, TBH. I keep going until the dough tells me to stop&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Salt&lt;/strong>: Mix in the salt. Then let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Semolina porridge&lt;/strong>: Divide the porridge into 3-4 portions; spread over the dough one portion at a time; mix until evenly distributed. With the porridge added back, no part of the grain is removed. Let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Triple hydration&lt;/strong>: Add the rest of the water, Rubaud-mixing until completely incorporated. Let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Tahini&lt;/strong>: Drizzle in the tahini, Rubaud-mixing until entirely combined.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cold ferment&lt;/strong>: Transfer the dough to a fridge (or somewhere 38¬∞F-43¬∞F) right away and ferment for 24 hours; take it out every few hours and perform a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JQm2n4aVZc">coil-fold&lt;/a> with a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds. I did 4 folds in total and folded in all of the toasted sesame seeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Shape &amp;amp; final proof&lt;/strong>: After 24 hours of bulk fermentation (~85% volume increase), shape the dough into whatever form you want. Roll it in the rest of black sesame seeds. Let it warm up to room temperature for 2-3 hours before baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The dough had a subtle toasty aroma, and surprised me with its softness and ease of handling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Artisanal boules look visually stunning, but are a &lt;em>de facto&lt;/em> pain in the butt to slice and freeze. Since I&amp;rsquo;m more pragmatic than artistic, I prefer the humble shape of a sandwich loaf &amp;ndash; much more space-efficient in the freezer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I shaped the dough into a log, proofed it seam-side up in a wide loaf pan, and baked with no scoring/slashing. The bread cracked open all on its own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind I baked this bread in my countertop toaster oven. It probably comes out prettier and crustier in a better oven with some fancy steaming apparatus &amp;ndash; or even a wood-fired oven.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With a long fermentation and crispy aromatic sesame seeds (toasted during baking) on the outside, you get an irresistible bread that gives you the distinct flavors of the whole durum wheat, the chew from the hardness of this wheat (after all, it&amp;rsquo;s the wheat of choice for pasta), and its wonderful infusion with the toasted sesame seeds.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The crust is so thin and soft that it would be non-existent if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the sesame seeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each slice feels light, soft, and springy in my hand. It tastes soft like a brioche, chewy like a pasta; exceptionally smooth, custardy, and creamy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The flavor is subtly sweet, reminiscent of pasta, and does not taste like whole wheat at all. There is a hint of saltiness and tanginess.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Most of the &lt;em>pani puglisi&lt;/em> I have eaten in Italy have those characteristics: a high percentage of fine durum wheat, an light crumb with irregular holes, a very chewy texture, and a long keeping time (days and days).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The semolina porridge contributes a cotton-like softness to the crumb. As an extra perk, it improved the bread&amp;rsquo;s keeping quality (after it&amp;rsquo;s first sliced). During baking, the porridge releases water slowly, resulting in a continuous softening of both the crumb and the crust.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>How does this 100% whole durum bread compare to the semolina breads I made before? For starters, I could smell the difference during baking. Both had wonderful aromas, but the 100% whole durum version had a strikingly richer and more vibrant aroma that I didn&amp;rsquo;t recall from the semolina. On the inside, this wholesome version has a slightly juicier and softer crumb with a richer hue of yellow, thanks to the gorgeous load of the freshly milled wholegrain durum flour. Now, you can simply taste more of the grain &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s sweeter, nuttier, and to me, more satisfying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The durum bread is a perfect example of how you can take an already great grain &amp;ndash; especially freshly milled &amp;ndash; to the next level. hence the bread&amp;rsquo;s golden color &amp;ndash; it is a combination of coarsely milled semolina and finely milled durum flours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried a slice of this bread dipped in olive oil with a little balsamic vinegar. That was spectacular! The magical combination of flavors was delightful. I thought about using this bread in other characteristic Italian ways &amp;ndash; as garlic bread, toasted and smeared with almond butter, or eaten with a hearty &lt;em>ribollito&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; but didn&amp;rsquo;t get that far. The bread was gone in 2 days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If there is one bread that I wish everyone could taste to see how wonderful a freshly milled wholegrain bread can be, this may be it: Light, fluffy, and soft in texture, with an airy crumb; the rich, nutty, sweet durum flavor shines right through; and the crunch of the sesame seeds on the exterior offers a pleasing contrast against the tenderness of the interior.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Pane di Altamura&lt;/em> is probably the most famous &lt;em>pane pugliese&lt;/em> (bread from the Puglia region of Italy); it&amp;rsquo;s even a DOP product. Other interesting durum breads include &lt;em>pane di Matera&lt;/em> and &lt;em>pane nero&lt;/em>; I attempted to bake my interpretation of the latter in this breadpost.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

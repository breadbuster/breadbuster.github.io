Irresistible and toothsome.</description><content>&lt;p>The US is still a superlulz &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jit.asp">JIT&lt;/a> la la land. One bullet is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/04/1140647869/power-substations-north-carolina-gunfire-vandalism">all it takes&lt;/a> to shut down the power grid for days&amp;hellip;possibly weeks. It reminded me of Juan Zarate&amp;rsquo;s memoir, &lt;em>Treasury&amp;rsquo;s War.&lt;/em> Unlike Europe, Uncle Sam is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance. Still, it feels like a first-world country with third-world infrastructure. As much as it sucks for the people affected, we are all living in an age of energy vulnerability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been to various parts of North freakin' Carolina a number of times. Charlotte, like any other financial center, is the most boring. The Research Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill) in the heart of Piedmont is more fun. Of course, nothing beats Asheville &amp;ndash; a hipster mecca. Best memories are licking my fingers after eating N&amp;rsquo;Asheville &amp;ldquo;Mount St. Hell No&amp;rdquo; spicy crispy fried chicken at &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE5SyITVOTE">Rocky&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a>, and getting caught in a rainstorm in Wilmington on the riverwalk and roaming the beaches like a drowned rat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until recently that I learned North Carolina is the #1 producer of sweet potatoes in the US.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week I stumbled across a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/udoyzj/pain_depices_au_levain_naturally_leavened_french/">reddit&lt;/a> on &lt;em>pain d&amp;rsquo;√©pices au levain&lt;/em>, got sidetracked, and went down a rabbit hole. I still have a ton of sweet potatoes left over from the Gobble Gobble Day. Why not create a &lt;em>pain d&amp;rsquo;√©pices&lt;/em> of my own, you know, heresy style? Maybe with a North Carolina character? Forgive me, France.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="homemade-spiced-syrup">Homemade spiced syrup&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>First off, I made a simple &lt;em>sirop d&amp;rsquo;√©pices&lt;/em> in the Instant Pot:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>60g aged orange peels&lt;/li>
&lt;li>30g fresh ginger&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 whole star anise&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 piece 4&amp;quot; cinnamon stick&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5 cloves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 allspice berries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>10 cardamom seeds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g raisin water (soak 150g raisins in 250g water for a few hours, and squeeze out the liquid)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g h‚ÇÇo&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Pressure-cooked for 1 minute, followed by 30 minutes of natural release. Then I left it overnight, to allow the aromatics to meld together further. The sweet orangey aroma wafted through the house. Next morning, I strained the whole mixture through a through a fine-mesh sieve, and filled up 2 big jars with the thin brown goodness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This homemade syrup packs quite a punch with its fragrant combination of spices. Delightfully sweet with a deep orange flavor, and chock full of bold, brisk notes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Pro tip&lt;/code>: Instead of throwing away the leftover aromatic pulp from straining, blend it finely into a sweet fruit paste. Use it as a delicious spread on toasts, or thin it a little and use as a marinade/sauce/glaze in savory dishes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="tar-heel-blend">Tar Heel Blend&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I decided to mix up my own Tar Heel Blend wheat flour, instead of using my go-to workhorse Turkey Red.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>60% Appalachian White (Fish Pond Branch Farms, NC): a HWWW with a mild creamy taste and ~12% protein&lt;/li>
&lt;li>20% NuEast (Fish Pond Branch Farms, NC): a HRWW with a delicate nutty flavor and ~10% protein&lt;/li>
&lt;li>20% Sungold spelt (Red Tail Grains, NC): a modern cultivar of spelt with ~12% protein&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Much like Missouri, the eastern US is not hospitable to growing bread wheat, because the area&amp;rsquo;s humidity increases the incidence of disease in the fields and affects yield and quality of the grain. Historically, North Carolina has grown almost exclusively soft wheats (lower protein, better for crackers, biscuits, etc). But, in response to a growing demand from the resurgence of artisan bakeries, two modern high-yielding cultivars of hard winter wheat, Appalachian White and NuEast, were bred by NC State researchers and &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2009/ars-releases-first-hard-winter-wheat-varieties-for-eastern-us-production/">released in 2009&lt;/a> to farmers as high-quality bread wheats suited for production in the Carolinas.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I let it ferment (for ~18 hours at 65F) until it got loose and bubbly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="final-dough">Final dough&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>While the levain is fermenting, cook the sweet potatoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want your sweet potatoes sweeter, cook them &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-mashed-sweet-potatoes-recipe">low and slow&lt;/a>, so that the enzyme will have more time to break down more starch and convert it to more maltose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I heated a pot of plain water in an Instant Pot to ~160F, and threw a few whole Carolina Ruby sweet potatoes directly into it. I covered up the pot, and let the spuds rest in the warm water bath overnight. You want to hold the sweet spuds in that 135F-170F (57C-77C) sweet spot for an extended period of time, to activate their endogenous enzymes that bring out their natural sweetness. After a few hours, you can take the sweet spuds out of the water bath, roast and mash them.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>I squished up the flour with 1/2 of the spiced syrupy water and the cooled sweet potato, and autolyzed for 2 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the autolyse, I squeezed all of the levain into the dough, while adding 1/2 of the remaining sweet water in several increments. Gave it a few rounds of slap &amp;amp; fold until it reached a semi-homogeneous texture, to make sure everything was evenly incorproated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a 20-minute rest, I squished in the salt and the rest of the sweet water. The dough looked and felt like a sticky mess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did a coil-fold every 20 minutes for the first hour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the 2h mark, I added the chocolate pieces, and gave the dough another coil-fold so that all of the chocolate bits were completely enveloped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did two more coil-folds at the 3h and 4h marks, respectively, to make sure the chocolate goodies were totally distributed throughout the dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dough started to feel puffy. I decided to stop turning it, and let it ferment, unmolested, in the sunroom overnight (~43F).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next morning, the dough had doubled in volume. I let it warm up on the kitchen counter for 2 hours. Then I shaped it into a boule and placed it in a proofing bowl, seam-side down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the surface of the dough reached ~60F, I dumped it out onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper, and baked it in the toaster oven. 350F for the first 20 minutes, and 325F for 20 more minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I let the bread cool for 4 hours before slicing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bread surrounding the little nuggets of chocolate was not bland at all! It was ever so gently sweetened by the simple syrup, like everything was magically pulled together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crumb was tender and springy, the sweetish flavor in harmony with the chocolate and spices; the crust was crispy and fabulous. Another winner for my repertoire!&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Broom Rider</title><link>/posts/broom-rider/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2019 15:59:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>/posts/broom-rider/</guid><description>A powerfully tasty broom for your colon.</description><content>&lt;p>In Deuteronomy 8:8, the Lord promised the Israelites a land &amp;ldquo;of wheat and barley.&amp;rdquo; And it was five barley loaves that Jesus divided to feed the five thousand in the story of &amp;ldquo;the loaves and the fishes.&amp;rdquo; Many people are familiar with the mild, nutty flavor of barley in soup and stews, but few have probably eaten barley in a bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ancient Greeks had a method of divination using barley cakes or loaves of barley bread. It&amp;rsquo;s called alphitomancy (&amp;ldquo;√°lphito&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;barley&amp;rdquo;), and the diviner who used barley is a &lt;em>alphit√≥mantis&lt;/em>. A quantity of pure barley was kneaded with milk, a little salt and without leaven. Then it was wrapped up in a greased paper, baked directly in a fire, and rubbed with verbena leaf when finished. When someone in a group was suspected of a crime, all of the suspects would be fed slices of this barley bread, as it was assumed that those innocent could eat it perfectly, while the guilty person would choke and get indigestion. On certain days of the year, young women would enter the woods carrying cakes made of barley and honey. It was said that the devil led the women into the woods. Supposedly, the serpent ate the cakes of the innocent women, but refused the cakes of the others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A &amp;ldquo;barleycorn&amp;rdquo; is an English unit of length based on the size of a dried grain of barley. One inch was defined as being equal to three barleycorns. Used as early as the 10th century in Britain, it was mostly replaced by imperial units through the Weights and Measures Act of 1824. But the barleycorn legacy remains &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s still used as the basis of shoe sizes in English-speaking countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the Irish Rebellion of 1798 (known as &lt;em>√âir√≠ Amach 1798&lt;/em> in the Irish and &lt;em>The Hurries&lt;/em> in Ulster Scots), soldiers often carried barley in their pockets as provisions when on the march. Every spring after the rebellion, the folklore goes, small fields of barley would sprout and mark &amp;ldquo;croppy-holes,&amp;rdquo; unmarked mass graves into which these man were thrown in. To many Irish nationalists, barley growing every spring from these &amp;ldquo;croppy-holes&amp;rdquo; symbolized the regenerative nature of Irish resistance to British rule. The Irish poet Robert Dwyer Joyce wrote a ballad to memorialize the soldiers, titled &amp;ldquo;The Wind That Shakes the Barley.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Caff√® d&amp;rsquo;orzo was a coffee substitute in Italy during the two World Wars, made mainly
from finely ground roasted barley. It&amp;rsquo;s still a popular drink today, and marketed worldwide as a healthy (naturally caffeine-free) and delicious Italian alternative to coffee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The modern word &amp;ldquo;barn&amp;rdquo; comes from the Old English word &amp;ldquo;b√¶rlic&amp;rdquo;, which means &amp;ldquo;of
barley.&amp;rdquo; You see, all of our barns are really just barley houses. Until ~200 years ago, barley was probably the No.1 bread grain of continental Europe and was carried to the New World by the early settlers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Barley (&lt;em>Hordeum vulgare L.&lt;/em>) has a thick fibrous hull, a high level of √ü-glucans and simply-arranged starch granules. Over the last half-century, worldwide production of wheat has quadrupled while the production of barley has barely doubled. Global production of barley is about 30% of that of corn. Compared to corn, barley has more protein, methionine, lysine, cysteine and tryptophan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Barley has been cultivated and consumed since ancient times. But why hasn&amp;rsquo;t it been granted the same &amp;ldquo;ancient grain&amp;rdquo; status that einkorn, emmer, and spelt now enjoy?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, barley is cultivated mostly as animal feed, with two uses: grain yield and grazing. For ruminants, barley is the third most readily degradable cereal behind oats and wheat, and has a more rapid starch fermentation rate than corn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The world&amp;rsquo;s most nutritious barley is said to be grown in the Red River Valley, a beautiful stretch of land between the rolling plains of North Dakota and the lakes and forests of Minnesota. It isn&amp;rsquo;t your traditional valley &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s nestled on flat, fertile ground that follows the coils of the mighty Red River as it flows north from South Dakota to Canada. The soil is what sets the Red River Valley apart. The rich, dark soil produces barley that contains the highest amounts of protein and other nutrients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The value-added market for barley is in malting and beer production, and as such the malting and brewing industry has set the quality specifications for barley grain being delivered after harvest. The key malt trait is hot water extract (HWE). High levels of HWE are desirable, as it provides an indication of malt quality as well as potential brewhouse performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Malted barley is used for brewing ales and lagers, pilsners, IPAs and pale ales. Besides providing the sugars that get fermented into alcohol, malts and grains provide a full range of flavors in beer &amp;ndash; from light cracker, toast, and biscuit to coffee, dark chocolate, dried fruits and brown sugar. Malt is what gives a beer color, richness, and complexity. It&amp;rsquo;s obviously a key ingredient for breweries, yet nearly all domestically malted barley comes just from a few companies &amp;ndash; Rahr, Briess, Cargill, and Great Western. In recent years, craft maltsters have been on the rise, but craft malt is still a tiny fraction of overall malt production.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Barley has such a low gluten content that it must be mixed with wheat flour to make a tall, fluffy loaf. The flavor of barley is mild, and the color is a grayish white. It adds a subtle nutty barley flavor to the bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing beats the warm, nutty flavor of toasted flaxseeds. So you should totally toast the flaxseeds first &amp;ndash; in a skillet, oven or microwave &amp;ndash; to bring out the richest flavors they have. Then soak the flaxseeds in milk kefir (could use plain vanilla h‚ÇÇo, buttermilk, etc). Leave the pudding in the fridge for a few hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gently shake a pinch of cinnamon into the flours. Autolyze with almond milk for 2 hours. You can keep it in the fridge, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add the levain and salt. Mix well until thoroughly combined. Add all of the flaxseed pudding, and mix until evenly distributed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perform 4-5 folds in the next 3 hours. Warm bulk-fermentation should last 5 hours in total.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shape. 18 hours final proof in a fridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let the dough warm up before baking.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Back in my college days, whenever I needed to pull some all-nighters, I would always chew on a handful of chocolate-covered Colombian coffee beans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A while ago, I got some Ethiopian Amaro Gayo green coffee beans. I roasted them at home until just after the first crack, and have been drinking the cold brew as my summer morning Joe. It&amp;rsquo;s acidic, floral and citrusy, reminding me of orange marmalade and cocoa.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The zero-waster in me couldn&amp;rsquo;t stand the thought of just throwing out these spent coffee grounds, so memories of chewing gourmet coffee beans in college gave me the idea of incorporating these spent coffee grounds into baked goods. ‚òïüçû&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Danish startup has come up with &lt;a href="https://www.kaffebueno.com/post/introducing-kaffe-bueno-coffee-flour">Kaffe Bueno¬†Flour&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Kaffe Bueno¬†Flour¬Æ¬†comes from used coffee grounds,¬†recycled¬†from selected hotels and offices in Copenhagen. Then, we¬†extract¬†the oil inside the grounds and further sterilise¬†them.¬†&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The result is a naturally¬†gluten-free coffee flour. Although it comes from coffee, its coffee taste is mostly gone along with the oil extracted. Its taste leans towards nutty,¬†chocolaty side.¬†&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>They even have a &lt;a href="https://www.kaffebueno.com/post/how-to-make-sourdough-bread-with-coffee-flour-vegan-recipe">recipe&lt;/a> for a coffee sourdough, in which the coffee flour is ~11% of flour weight in the final dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dan Lepard has a formula for his famous &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190908145402/https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/dan-lepard-s-black-pepper-rye">Black Pepper Rye&lt;/a>, which uses brewed black coffee to make a roux with a rye first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, on the spur of the moment, I strained some coffee grounds from my cold brew, and left them to dry over a dehumidifier for a few hours. When the grounds were thoroughly dry, I ground them again in a coffee grinder to yield a much finer &amp;ldquo;coffee flour.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="white-wheat--white-flour">White wheat =/= white flour&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I wanted to use mild-tasting flour for this bread, so the coffee flavor can come through. Colorado Windy White, a modern hard white winter wheat (HWWW) variety grown by Sunflower Acres (the retail front is Grains from the Plains), fits the bill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you grind up white wheat to make flour, it looks off-white, kind of like unbleached &amp;ldquo;white flour.&amp;rdquo; But they are not the same thing. Most commercial white flour is made from red wheat that has been refined (the bitter, bulky parts of bran and germ are removed, leaving only the starchy endosperm) &amp;ndash; and in most cases it has been treated with bleach and potassium bromate, and then &amp;ldquo;enriched&amp;rdquo; with artificial vitamins since the natural ones have been lost during processing. This results in a homogeneous product with a long shelf life, which produces consistently fluffy baked goods &amp;ndash; but at the cost of nutrition and flavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>White wheat is pretty much the same as red wheat, except that it has no major genes for bran color. White whole wheat flour has a milder, sweeter flavor than red whole wheat flour, due to lack of phenolic compounds and lower tannin content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the US, many breads are made with hard white (whole) wheat containing &amp;gt;= 10% protein:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Brands owned by Bimbo, the largest bakery company in the US: Arnold, Sara Lee, Mrs. Bairds, Stroehmann, Freihofer&amp;rsquo;s, EarthGrains, Brownberry, Francisco, Grandma Sycamore&amp;rsquo;s, J.J. Nissen, Lender&amp;rsquo;s Bagels, Oroweat, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brands owned by Flowers Foods, the second largest bakery company in the US: Wonder Bread, Nature&amp;rsquo;s Own, Captain John Derst&amp;rsquo;s, Sunbeam, Evangeline Maid, Mrs. Freshley&amp;rsquo;s, Merita, Cobblestone Mill, European Bakers, Mi Casa, Bunny Bread, HomePride, Tastykake, and Dave&amp;rsquo;s Killer Bread.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Aunt Millie&amp;rsquo;s (Perfection Bakeries, Inc)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Soft white wheat (typically &amp;lt; 10% protein) is the star ingredient in Kellogg&amp;rsquo;s Mini Wheats and Wheat Flakes, as well as Nabisco&amp;rsquo;s Triscuit crackers. Kellogg&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Open for Breakfast&amp;rdquo; website tells the stories of a 4,000-acre soft white wheat farm in Michigan, close to the company&amp;rsquo;s HQ. There is some evidence that breakfast cereals made with white whole wheat hold their crispness longer in milk. Triscuit&amp;rsquo;s product description goes, &amp;ldquo;We like to think of Soft White Winter Wheat as a kind of cashmere of wheat because of its soft texture and delicious taste. It&amp;rsquo;s what gives Triscuit its golden color, distinctive crunch and 24 grams of delicious whole grain goodness per serving.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Asians love soft white wheat, too, because they believe it makes better noodles &amp;ndash; bright, clear white, soft inside but firm on the surface. When made with white wheat, fresh refrigerated noodles will not develop black specks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Japanese prefecture Kagawa, the home of the &lt;em>udon&lt;/em> noodle, a white wheat reclamation is underway. Before the 1960s, fields of wheat covered the town of Sanuki (the old name of Kagawa). The local Sanuki wheat would be harvested, milled and sifted to make flour for Sanuki &lt;em>udon&lt;/em>. But after repeated bad weather in the early 1960s, wheat production declined sharply and imported Australian Standard White (ASW) wheat soon became the major variety. Some local noodle makers and aficionados found imported wheat to be inferior and produced subpar &lt;em>udon&lt;/em> flour, so they worked together with small farmers to revive Kagawa&amp;rsquo;s soul food, i.e. &lt;em>udon&lt;/em> made from Sanuki-grown wheat. In 2000, they developed a new variety of wheat for &lt;em>udon&lt;/em> named &lt;em>sanuki no yume&lt;/em> (&amp;ldquo;Sanuki&amp;rsquo;s dream&amp;rdquo;) and later in 2009 a newer variety based on the OG. Since 2013, almost the entire wheat field in Kawaga grows &lt;em>sanuki no yume&lt;/em> 2009. Kinoshita Flour Mills in Kagawa sells a &lt;em>udon&lt;/em> flour made with 100% Kagawa-grown wheat (8.5% protein). They use a meticulous milling process to remove all the bran because, as explained on their website, &amp;ldquo;speck, a small piece of bran, would damage the taste and the food texture of the Udon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They can keep their noodles, I will make bread. There are thousands of other foods I would rather eat. &lt;em>Mon pain quotidien&lt;/em>, first and foremost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="milling">Milling&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Bread made from finely milled wholegrain flour has a tender texture, a slight chew, a rustic hue, and robust wheat flavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Note&lt;/code>: Working with freshly milled single-varietal whole grains is not as predictable as a standard bag of King Arthur or other name-brand Ô¨Çour, which remain consistent by blending varieties of wheats from multiple years or regions. Whole grains are living and vibrant; shelf-stable flours are dead. Working with whole grains is challenging and requires you to be willing to learn new skills and pay greater attention to the process, rather than relying on recipes where you can simply plug in your ingredients and yield the same results. Grains are a lot like coffee &amp;ndash; you have to think about, &amp;ldquo;When was this roasted? When was this ground?&amp;rdquo; You can taste the difference in Ô¨Çavor and texture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Freshly milled flour works a bit differently from shelf-stable flour:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>It contains more enzymes and minerals, and ferments faster than store-bought ones;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It contains volatile oils from the bran and germ; store-bought flour has had some oils evaporated off or may not even have had the germ in it, depending on the brand.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Freshly milled wholegrain flour is best for Desem, the old Flemish method specifically developed for 100% wholegrain bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="bolting">Bolting&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I ground up the wheat berries in a grain mill, and sifted the flour through a mesh sieve to screen out the coarsest bits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bolted flour contains almost all of the germ, and the softer parts of the bran. In exchange for a loss of mainly fiber and minerals, the resulting flour performs more like a bread or all-purpose flour while maintaining some of the rich flavor, nutritional benefits, and lovely color of wholegrain flours. It has a creamy texture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Historically, bolted flour was sifted through &lt;a href="https://www.angelfire.com/journal/millbuilder/boulting.html">a piece of cloth&lt;/a>. Nowadays it&amp;rsquo;s typically done through a metal or plastic screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The total flour out of the sifter divided by the total flour out of the mill would give you the extraction percentage. The higher the percentage, the closer to whole grain flour it is. 100% extraction is whole wheat. Home-milling and bolting wheat will give you incredible flavor that&amp;rsquo;s impossible to beat.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Do the same thing with whole rye berries &amp;ndash; mill them, but skip the bolting. Leave the rye flour coarse and wholesome. Rye is a cousin to wheat and mills similarly, but the two have very different baking qualities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IMO, rye is one of the tastiest, most nutrient-dense grains. It yields a peppery-earthy flavor and improves the keeping quality of whatever you make with it. Feeding sourdough starter with rye keeps it vigorous, sour and fruity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Abruzzi rye is an Italian heirloom variety. The kernels are bluish-gold in appearance, and smell nutty and sweet like a blend of herbal spices and citrus. It was famous in the Carolinas during the colonial era. Did you know it was the very rye flour used in &amp;ldquo;thirded bread&amp;rdquo;, a cost-cutting recipe that combined rye, wheat, and cornmeal (instead of oats) plus the sweet upgrade of molasses, such as Boston brown bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Small amounts have big results. Blending merely 5% of rye into a wheat bread will add a depth of flavor, without overpowering others.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="method">Method&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I have a big batch of &lt;em>zakvaska&lt;/em>¬†left from making rye bread &lt;em>kvass&lt;/em>. So I used some &lt;em>zakvaska&lt;/em>, instead of the usual WW sourdough starter, to build a 100% hydration levain for this bread. It doubled in volume overnight, brimming with bubbles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I autolysed all of the flours with coffee for 1 hour. Then I added the levain and salt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did 5 folds during the first 3 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After 5 hours of warm bulk-fermentation, I shaped the dough into a log, coated it with a handful of flaxseeds, and placed it in my ghetto banneton. I left it in the fridge overnight to proof.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next day, I left the dough in a warm place for 2.5 hours to finish proofing. The dough rose 80%-90%, and felt so jiggly! Then I baked it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The bread almost tripled from the initial dough! The crust bloomed nicely from the seams and had beautifully caramelized spots.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="cooling">Cooling&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The final stage of baking bread is letting it cool properly. If you were to slice into a hot loaf of bread, you would not be doing it any justice. The heat retained inside the bread continues to cook it and develop flavor/texture, so slicing it too early interrupts this process prematurely.¬†Also, cutting warm bread allows moisture to escape into the air, which means it will go stale faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the breads cool, the process of starch retrogradation is completed and the water molecules move outward, evenly, toward the crust. If you were to cut into a hot loaf, the crumb is still too soft and the bread won&amp;rsquo;t slice neatly, it will tend to be gummy and stick to your knife. Allow your loaves to firm up and cool to about body temperature before slicing. Breads that can be eaten while they are still warm are rolls and baguettes, because the crust-to-crumb ratio is so high, and there is not much further internal cooking that has to take place.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="tasting">Tasting&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The crust is thin and crispy, and the crumb springy and soft. The cold brew coffee lent a nice color to the bread. The coffee flour definitely added a unique bite and a smoky accent. There is no smell or taste of morning Joe, but you can feel the coffee grounds caressing your tongue.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I enjoyed the bread with a wedge of Comt√© &amp;ndash; a flavor explosion! The pair reminded me of condensed milk, cocoa and macadamia nut. Washed it down with some &lt;em>el cheapo&lt;/em> Pacific Peaks merlot. The smokiness of the wine reminded me of the coffee notes in this bread.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>

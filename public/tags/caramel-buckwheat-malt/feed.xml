&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m surprised how many people watch only HBO and whatever the Netflix algorithm recommends. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like the folks who email me asking factual questions &amp;ndash; have they never heard of the internet? There&amp;rsquo;s a vast cornucopia of streaming series out there; if you pick the right one, your life will be enhanced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last night I watched the final two episodes of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farzi">Farzi&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; while licking a plate of buttery &lt;a href="https://authenticsimplifiedrecipes.wordpress.com/2019/02/21/pav-bhaji/">&lt;em>pav bhaji&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. When the show was over, I spontaneously exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;That was great!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Frankly, not as great as &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bureau_(TV_series)">&lt;em>Le Bureau des Lﾃｩgendes&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2324587/">&lt;em>Poﾄ絞vali u miru&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, but really fulfilling. And it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find those shows these days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Farzi&amp;rdquo; is about the rigid caste system in India, where upward mobility is extremely limited. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t dream. Opportunities are closed. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you&amp;rsquo;re not smart or willful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most people are so addicted to brands (e.g. HBO or Apple TV+). They watch only light stuff like comedy; they say real life is daunting enough, they don&amp;rsquo;t want to be brought down by a show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s what life is all about: new experiences, stretching your horizons, because otherwise you&amp;rsquo;d end up living on repeats, waiting to die.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with uncommon grains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wheat has been the hegemony in the bread world, while barley reigns supreme in the brewing industry. Malt has become synonymous with barley the way that flour has with wheat, but malt can be made from any type of (pseudo)grain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="buckwheat">Buckwheat&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The only exposure most people in the West have to buckwheat is in pancakes, which is quite sad.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Buckwheat (&lt;em>Fagopyrum sagittatum syn. F. esculentum&lt;/em>) is a curious and misunderstood food. It&amp;rsquo;s not a &amp;ldquo;wheat&amp;rdquo;, but is treated like one. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a shrub, related to rhubarb; it produces seeds on the flower heads. These seeds (or kernels) are what get ground into flour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like other seeds, buckwheat is high in both protein (18% by weight!) and fiber, but it&amp;rsquo;s unique among the seeds we typically eat, because it&amp;rsquo;s mainly composed of carbs, with lower fat and higher starch content than, say, sunflower seeds or chia seeds. IMO, buckwheat has a well-balanced starch, protein, fat, and mineral composition, and is absolutely delicious. Hands-down one of my favorite &amp;ldquo;cereals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buckwheat was long thought to have originated in central Asia, somewhere between Lake Baikal and Manchuria. Recent &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02861199">research&lt;/a> now leans toward southwest China and the Himalayan region as the center of origin. The two cultivated species of buckwheat, &lt;em>Fagopyrum esculentum&lt;/em> (common buckwheat) and &lt;em>Fagopyrum tataricum&lt;/em> (tartary buckwheat) are Chinese domesticates, presumably originating in upland southwest China, outside the major rice and millet centers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buckwheat is known as &lt;em>grano saraceno&lt;/em> in Italian and &lt;em>sarrasin&lt;/em> in French, leading the late food writer Waverly Root to assume that buckwheat originated in Asia Minor and was introduced by either the Turks, the Crusaders, and/or the Moors to places in Europe where other grains didn&amp;rsquo;t grow well and where the people ate &amp;ldquo;robustly&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; such as Brittany, Finland, Styria, central France and the Tyrolian Alps. Europeans of the Middle Ages, however, used the term &amp;ldquo;saracen&amp;rdquo; to describe many things that simply came from the East, whether they were Arabian or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the contemporary Italian botanist Valerio Giacomini, who has made a thorough study of buckwheat, there are three possible ways buckwheat arrived in Europe:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>through southern Russia, Poland, and Germany &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Belgium and France;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>through Turkey &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Greece, Hungary, and southern Russia; and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>through the maritime contacts of Venice, which might explain in part the ascription of &amp;ldquo;saracen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There is a legend that Joos van Ghistele brought it back with him from his journey to the Holy Land in 1485. Who knows. In any case, the origin of buckwheat is unknown, even if its name in Latin languages suggests an Arab provenance. The plant&amp;rsquo;s English name, &amp;ldquo;buckwheat&amp;rdquo;, came from the Dutch word for &amp;ldquo;beech&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em>boec&lt;/em>) and wheat, because it can be used in food, like wheat.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>What seems certain, though, is that buckwheat has been a traditional food around the world, particularly in regions with short growing seasons and poor soil. Eastern Europeans eat a porridge of toasted buckwheat groats (&lt;em>kasha&lt;/em>). In the mountainous valley of Lombardy, Italy, a traditional winter dish is &lt;em>pizzoccheri&lt;/em>, basically short buckwheat pasta tossed with butter, cabbage, cheese, garlic, and sage &amp;ndash; a poor &amp;ldquo;peasant&amp;rdquo; tradition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buckwheat has a rich history in the United States as well, unlike other ancient grains. It was common during the Colonial era, but began to decline in popularity after the Civil War ended.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="malted-buckwheat">Malted buckwheat&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I had the good fortune of experimenting with some caramel buckwheat malt from &lt;a href="https://grousemalthouse.com/">Grouse Malt House&lt;/a>, a dedicated gluten-free craft malthouse in Wellington, Colorado. (I was not looking for gluten-free alternatives &lt;em>per se&lt;/em>, but rather malts made from uncommon grains. Grouse has been crafting a ton of those since ~2013.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dark, triangular-shaped hulls covering the buckwheat seeds are left on, to help brewers lauter/filter more easily. The hull is very tough, but is edible when ground and provides a good source of fiber. Even after soaking and boiling, though, unhulled buckwheat is too chewy and too earthy for most people&amp;rsquo;s palates.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="Grouse BK1060 caramel buckwheat malt"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Caramel buckwheat malt (BK1060), from Grouse Malt House (Wellington, Colorado).&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This malt, out of the box, smelled like a forest right after a rain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buckwheat can be milled with or without the hull. The traditional method is milling with the hulls. And yes, some millers even add extra hulls. Flour ground from unhulled buckwheat will be greyish, with tiny black specks &amp;ndash; it looks darker and tastes a tad stronger than flour made from hulled buckwheat (groats).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When freshly ground, this caramel buckwheat malt has an unmistakable earthy aroma &amp;ndash; it creates a woodsy vibe that&amp;rsquo;s bold but not overly aggressive, evoking mental imagery of a deep, verdant forest. There&amp;rsquo;s also a little sunflower seed-like nutty aroma. It tastes predominantly earthy &amp;ndash; like unmalted buckwheat or yellow split peas &amp;ndash; with a hint of malty sweetness. Just how I like my buckwheat, despite the lack of a quintessential &amp;ldquo;caramel&amp;rdquo; malt vibe.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Many Westerners don&amp;rsquo;t like that robust flavor of unhulled buckwheat. So there&amp;rsquo;s a large market for buckwheat flour &lt;em>sans&lt;/em> the hulls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know pretty well how buckwheat performs and tastes in food, but in beer? I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure. Enzymatic activities are &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228618138_The_Impact_of_Kilning_on_Enzymatic_Activity_of_Buckwheat_Malt">found&lt;/a> to be low in pale buckwheat malt. I would probably agree with what &lt;a href="https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/buckwheat-questions.449416/#post-5789674">this brewer&lt;/a> said about buckwheat:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I suspect that you will be disappointed with the flavor and diastatic power of pale-malt buckwheat, though. If my experience with Colorado Malting Company&amp;rsquo;s buckwheat malt is any indicator, about the only way to coax any flavor out of it is to make crystal malt; but even that doesn&amp;rsquo;t do much, considering very little saccharification takes place during the crystal-making process so you don&amp;rsquo;t get much in the way of caramelized sugars. The only use I have for buckwheat in my beers is unmalted as an adjunct to improve head retention (the malted stuff doesn&amp;rsquo;t do as well in that regard due to changes in protein contents), or else roasted really dark, as a stand-in for Briess &amp;ldquo;Midnight Wheat&amp;rdquo; to impart a smooth roast character to darker beers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Which is why I picked &amp;ldquo;caramel&amp;rdquo; buckwheat malt, not the other two buckwheat options (BK1001 pale and BK1100 roasted) offered by Grouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Caramel malt is typically made from &amp;ldquo;green malt&amp;rdquo; (wet germinated malt) or rehydrated base malt, mashed at 140-160ﾂｰF so that the amylase in each individual grain kernel degrades the starch within into simple sugars, and subsequently dried out at &amp;gt;=170ﾂｰF, which causes the sugars inside the malt to crystallize. It also causes the sugars and nitrogen-based compounds (mostly amino acids and proteins) to combine to form melanoidins. The major variable in the process is the kilning temperature, which determines the depth of the color and the degree of caramelization. The higher the drying temperature, the darker the color will be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During roasting, most (if not all) of the enzymes in the malt become denatured, and many of the sugars in the malt become caramelized and thus unfermentable, which is why caramel malt is usually used (like an adjunct) to add sweetness and body to the finished beer, instead of as a base malt.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="buckwheat-mash">Buckwheat mash&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In &amp;ldquo;caramel&amp;rdquo; malts made from common grains like barley and wheat, the starch is already gelatinized and saccharified in the core. Malted buckwheat gelatinizes at a temperature that is higher than that at which the amylase becomes denatured. To get any significant fermentables out of buckwheat, a decoction mash or exogenous enzymes may be necessary. Andrew Lavery has some &lt;a href="https://glutenfreehomebrewing.com/lavery_brewing_tutorial.php">good info&lt;/a> on mashing gluten-free grains.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>30 minutes at 95ﾂｰF&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 hour at ~113ﾂｰF&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 hour at ~130ﾂｰF (decocted 1/3 at the end; boiled for 5 minutes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 hours at ~150ﾂｰF (decocted 1/3 at the end; and boiled for 5 minutes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 hour at ~160ﾂｰF (decocted 1/3 at the end; boiled for 5 minutes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 hour at ~170ﾂｰF&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The buckwheat malt soaks up water like a sponge, so this mash turned out very thick. It smelled mildly sweet and smoky, reminiscent of toasted sesame seeds. Not at all what you&amp;rsquo;d expect with a typical &amp;ldquo;caramel&amp;rdquo; malt made from barley or wheat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After saccharification, the mash tasted sweet-ish and boldly buckwheaty.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="buckwheat-barm">Buckwheat barm&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A lot of people consider the flavor of buckwheat to be in the same general category as rye, but far more rustic, earthy, and flavorful than any of the routinely used grains. Part of that character derives from buckwheat&amp;rsquo;s caprylic acid content. Caprylic acid (octanoic acid) is a medium-chain fatty acid that is naturally found in palm oil, coconut oil, and milk. It&amp;rsquo;s a part of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) products, and believed to have potent antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. FYI, &lt;em>capr&lt;/em>- comes from Latin &lt;em>capra&lt;/em>, meaning &amp;ldquo;goat&amp;rdquo;; a lot of people say buckwheat adds a load of &amp;ldquo;goaty&amp;rdquo; flavor, which I disagree with.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>One great thing about some &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo;-tasting fatty acids is that they provide appealing aromas after &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> combines them with a molecule of ethanol to form an ester. Buckwheat has been &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228761224_Processing_of_a_Top_Fermented_Beer_Brewed_from_100_Buckwheat_Malt_with_Sensory_and_Analytical_Characterisation">researched&lt;/a> for its possible caprylic acid contribution to &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> fermentation, during which the Brett might convert these fatty acid precursors to create ethyl caprylate, an ester often described as sweet, waxy, floral, fruity, pineapple, and wine.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Kolnasﾄ》a is traditionally used to &lt;a href="https://www.kulinaraismantojums.lv/en/biedri/home-producers/production-of-home-brewed-beer-kolnasata/">brew beers at home in Latgale&lt;/a> (aka. the land of blue lakes), a historical region in eastern Latvia. The brewing usually takes place in wooden tuns, and calls for locally-grown barley malt that&amp;rsquo;s dried in a smoke sauna.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This yeast is expected to produce &amp;ldquo;ample doses of pineapple esters along with medium attenuation and flocculation.&amp;rdquo; I thought this profile would pair well with the other yeasts I was going to add to the barm later on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Escarpment&amp;rsquo;s recommended temperature range for Kolnasﾄ》a is 68-86ﾂｰF, so I let the inoculated mash (aka. barm) ferment, loosely covered, at 80-84ﾂｰF for 12 hours. The barm began to show signs of fermentation and exude a subtle fruity aroma like peach and pineapple.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Next, I added 0.9g of London Tropics from Berkeley Yeast. This London ale yeast-derived thiolized strain produced a POG bomb in a &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">previous experiment&lt;/a>, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to tone down the thiol level this time to see how the final bread might turn out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s recommended temperature range for London Tropics is 64-72ﾂｰF. I let the barm ferment at 66-70ﾂｰF for 24 hours. By the end, the thick mash had nearly risen by 50%-70% and felt fluffy. It smelled much more fruity, pleasantly balanced between guava and pineapple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Stage 3: Brettanomyces&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I intended to add 2g of &lt;em>Brettanomyces bruxellensis&lt;/em>. Due to a squirting accident with the homebrew pouch, I ended up adding 6g of the liquid yeast. The 6% inoculation rate was not intentional, but it is what it is.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Total: 187.9g&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I let this barm sit in my fermentation fridge (set to ~45ﾂｰF) for 4 days. The barm puffed up like my Italian &lt;em>lievito madre&lt;/em>, and developed a more complex aroma that was very pleasing, but hard to put into words.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Total: 1,329.7g (100% extraction = whole grain)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mixed all ingredients together into a supple and sticky dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>bulk fermentation: 2 hours at ~70ﾂｰF (the dough started to ferment so fast that I had to slow it down by chilling it) + 14 hours at ~45ﾂｰF&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>final proof: 3 hours at ~70ﾂｰF&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>bake: 45 minutes in total; 10 minutes at 400ﾂｰF and 35 minutes at 350ﾂｰF.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I was delightfully surprised by how much the bread rose during fermentation and baking.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The bread had a pleasant fruity fragrance, far less overpowering than in my &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">first experiment&lt;/a>. I detected some tantalizing notes of pineapple with a hint of lemon. The subtle tropical complexity and breezy tiki vibe complemented the toasty, earthy aroma of buckwheat quite nicely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Flavor-wise, it was predominantly earthy buckwheat (reminding me of toasted black sesame seeds), with a charming malty character and mildly fruity undertone. I liked it, a lot. While biting into it, I pictured myself in a hammock swaying on a sun-soaked island in the Black Sea.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you grew up poor like me and got used to eating &amp;ldquo;peasant food&amp;rdquo; like &lt;em>galettes de sarrasin&lt;/em>, &lt;em>kissel&lt;/em>, &lt;em>inaka soba&lt;/em>, etc., then you&amp;rsquo;ll most likely find the deep and earthy flavor of unhulled buckwheat satisfying and nourishing. Otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s probably an acquired taste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I guess quartering thiol levels in this bread worked out well. Once again, more isn&amp;rsquo;t (always) better. It&amp;rsquo;s all about understanding what you want to achieve and how your yeast will behave. Recipes are very overrated.&lt;/p>

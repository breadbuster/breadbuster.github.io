Over the last decade, being able to experience Noma has apparently become a status symbol. Funny how the culinary icon was &lt;em>forced&lt;/em> to shut down after it found itself facing financial difficulties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In October 2021, Noma &amp;ndash; arguably the most prestigious kitchen in the world &amp;ndash; started paying its interns (known as &lt;em>stagiaires&lt;/em>) for the first time. And that has added $50,000 to the restaurant&amp;rsquo;s monthly operating expenses, according to the NYT.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Rene Redzepi, chef-owner of Noma, said Monday that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible to make the math of fine dining work for his almost 100 employees and himself. &amp;hellip; In 2021, the restaurant lost money, even with government support, while selling $700 lunches.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Kate Krader, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://archive.is/JTOuA">Noma, One of the World‚Äôs Best Restaurants, Is Closing Its Doors&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, Bloomberg&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>According to an &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/files/Noma-offentliggorelse.pdf">annual report&lt;/a>, Noma received üá©üá∞ kr10.9 million (USD ~$1.57m) in Covid-19 compensation from the Danish government in 2021 while booking a net &lt;em>loss&lt;/em> of üá©üá∞ kr1.69 million (USD ~$240k); the previous year, it received üá©üá∞ kr8.05 million (USD ~$1.16m) in government financial aid and recorded a tiny profit of üá©üá∞ kr39,816 (USD ~$5,748).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, one pays USD ~$500/person to eat a weeknight dinner soberly at Noma. The restaurant can seat ~42 diners comfortably. Let&amp;rsquo;s say 20 people dine at Noma every night Tues-Fri and 20 at Saturday lunch. $500 x 20 ppl x 5 days = $50,000/week in gross revenue (not even counting beverages), or &amp;gt;=$200k per month. If Noma is fully booked every day, it would make at least $105k/week, &amp;gt;=$440k a month, or &amp;gt;= $5m a year. And that&amp;rsquo;s just a baseline projection. $50,000/month in labor cost for ~100 employees = $500/month for each worker!!! üò±üò®üò≥üò±üò± Can you survive on that anywhere in the developed world?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If &amp;ldquo;the world&amp;rsquo;s most influential restaurant&amp;rdquo; that brings in &lt;em>at least&lt;/em> a quarter million USD in gross revenue each freakin' month can&amp;rsquo;t keep its doors open while paying its workers a meager wage of $500/month, then this industry at large has some major restructuring and soul-searching to do. Numbers don&amp;rsquo;t lie.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Finnish chef Kim Mikkola, who worked at Noma for four years, said that fine dining, like diamonds, ballet and other elite pursuits, often has abuse built into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>‚ÄúEverything luxetarian is built on somebody‚Äôs back; somebody has to pay,‚Äù he said.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to mourn Noma&amp;rsquo;s closure, because there is no part of me that feels something is being lost or taken away. And no, I&amp;rsquo;ve never dined at Noma, so I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how life-changing a Noma meal was. I did read &lt;em>The Noma Guide to Fermentation&lt;/em> a few years ago and tried making the rye bread miso (&amp;ldquo;ryeso&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m glad Noma existed and Ren√© Redzepi realized a business that exploits unpaid labor is unsustainable, financially and morally. I hope the next restaurant that rises to influence global cuisine as much as Noma did will be a pioneer in some sort of real sustainability, not just propelled by fanaticism around a singular genius or its &lt;a href="https://theworld.org/stories/2012-04-08/fascist-food-fight">avant-garde fascism&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The truth is, however elaborately prepared or miraculously transformed, at the end of the day it&amp;rsquo;s just food &amp;ndash; something that you swallow and inevitably becomes shit. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s what made Anthony Bourdain so depressed.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A human being is primarily a bag for putting food into.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A lot of things are upside-down in the brave new Po-Lo (post-lockdown) world. Expensive fine dining as we know it seems to be &lt;a href="https://robbreport.com/paid-issue/death-fine-dining/">on its way out&lt;/a>. In fact, another destination for fine dining (in Silicon Valley), &lt;a href="https://sf.eater.com/2022/11/7/23444965/manresa-closing-reservations">Manresa&lt;/a>, closed in late 2022.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am reminded of &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9764362/">&lt;em>The Menu&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. The movie takes place mostly inside Hawthorne, a fictional uber-luxurious restaurant on a small island that seats only a dozen customers a night at $1,250/person. Workers are stuck between the belief that what they are doing (i.e. passionately pursuing their dreams) is worth sacrificing everything for and the reality that they have surrendered their lives to grueling service work which the monied class treats as merely social status accessories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is something strange about real life &amp;ndash; you can feel so plugged in and so distant at the same time. You want to be part of the action, but you find yourself on the outside. And then, if you get close enough, you realize that the main goal of so many on the inside is to keep you out, and to make you think they know something that you do not, which is patently untrue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Towards the end of &lt;em>The Menu&lt;/em>, Chef Slowik pours his heart and soul into making Margot a good old-fashioned cheeseburger, because he sees it as an opportunity to redeem himself from his failure to stay true to his art and make up for all the passionless meals he prepared for the rich. When Margot takes a bite and appreciates the burger for what it is &amp;ndash; a filling meal that satiates her hunger &amp;ndash; the chef finally feels proud and content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This burger reminds me of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz9z_Q7ced8">&lt;em>lablabi&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, a working-class staple in Tunisia. To make &lt;em>lablabi&lt;/em>, you basically pour a thin soup with boiled chickpeas over a pile of stale bread that&amp;rsquo;s torn up into tiny pieces. &lt;em>Lablabi&lt;/em> is cheap, quick, and filling; it fuels you for the rest of the day and keeps you warm during the winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the other end of the dining spectrum is &lt;a href="https://www.danperlman.net/1999/07/11/white-trash-dinner/">&amp;ldquo;trailer trash food&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, stuff that I imagine the main character in Barbara Kingsolver&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Demon Copperhead&lt;/em> grew up eating. I haven&amp;rsquo;t forgotten the shock I experienced when I first encountered the &lt;a href="https://www.thelunchbelle.com/recipes-1/2010/12/1/recipe-white-trash-ambrosia.html">ambrosia&lt;/a> at a working-class eatery in South Carolina: canned fruits were mixed with canned whipped cream, mayonnaise, sugar, and mini marshmallows, and topped with Cool Whip. It&amp;rsquo;s apparently a Southern holiday tradition. (The OG ambrosia made in the 1800s used only 3 ingredients: orange slices, grated coconut, and sugar.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A friend of mine recently went to Italy on vacation and brought me a &lt;em>panforte di Siena&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; a traditional Italian confection that&amp;rsquo;s a cross between fruitcake, candy, and &lt;em>Lebkuchen&lt;/em>. Basically, a dense, sweet &amp;ldquo;cake&amp;rdquo; made from candied fruits, nuts, spices, a touch of flour, and a sugar/honey syrup, dusted in powdered sugar on all sides. It tastes absolutely delicious, but far too sweet for me. I wanted to make a less sweet version with pretty much the same ingredients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I stumbled across &lt;a href="http://www.farine-mc.com/2012/02/hutzelbrot-with-dried-cherries-and.html">&lt;em>hutzelbrot&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, looked into it further, and fell down a &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%BCchtebrot">rabbit hole&lt;/a>&amp;hellip; Eric Carle&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://eric-carle.com/eric-carle-book-gallery/the-very-hungry-caterpillar-1969/">hungry caterpillar&lt;/a> ate &lt;em>das Fr√ºchtebrot&lt;/em>??&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Hutzelbrot&lt;/em> is a German fruit bread, originally made with dried pears (called &amp;ldquo;hutzeln&amp;rdquo; in Alemannisch), but it gained many regional names as well &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;zelten&amp;rdquo; (Bolzano), &amp;ldquo;schnitzbrot&amp;rdquo; (Schwaben), &amp;ldquo;birnebrot&amp;rdquo; (Das Allg√§u), &amp;ldquo;kletzenbrot&amp;rdquo; (Bavaria-Austria) or simply the more generic &amp;ldquo;fr√ºchtebrot&amp;rdquo; as it can be filled any dried fruits other than pears.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the old days, the stingy farmers' wives would dry the leftover pears to avoid food waste and make the &lt;em>hutzelbrot&lt;/em> on St. Thomas' day, December 21st (the winter solstice). The wives and maids would embrace their pear trees, with their hands and arms still covered in dough, to ensure a good harvest in the following year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing beats ye olde traditional recipe. From &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%BCchtebrot">Wikipedia&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Originally Fr√ºchtebrot was made without honey, brown sugar or white sugar, with the sweetness coming only from the dried pears. Equally uncommon is Fr√ºchtebrot made of wheat dough. Using wheat dough makes the bread look less rustic, but also hinders the combustion of the fruits baked into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So, it&amp;rsquo;s the medieval OG energy bar &amp;ndash; just dried fruits, nuts and a touch of rye flour!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>An 18th-century manuscript describes celteno, a predecessor of Zelten. The recipe reads: &amp;ldquo;Take some Candia grapes, raisins, pine nuts, peeled almonds cut long, minutely cut lemon peel, aniseed seeds, candied citron, cinnamon powder, a little sugar, and a little flour and mix everything together. Take a small piece of brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast, the size of a walnut&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The internet shows me many kinds of &lt;em>das Fr√ºchtebrot&lt;/em>, which roughly fall into two categories:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>yeast-leavened breads, such as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMtdyZAjq3U">this fr√ºchtebrot&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDgT6aqO9wc">Kletzenbrot aus der l√§ndlichen K√ºche&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v5Rzz73qhY">Schnitzbrot&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://heissehimbeeren.com/das-saftigste-original-fruechtebrot-rezept-von-oma/">grandma&amp;rsquo;s original Fr√ºchtebrot&lt;/a> (with rye flour). The yeasted dough usually goes through a first rise, before mixing with rehydrated dried fruits and nuts. The dough can barely enrobe the huge amount of add-ins, and acts more like a binder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>quick breads with baking powder, such as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t0bCzNaBfA">saftiges Fr√ºchtebrot&lt;/a> and &lt;em>Apfelbrot&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Marcel Paa&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.marcelpaa.com/rezepte/fruechtebrot">Fr√ºchtebrot-Powerbrot&lt;/a> uses a yeasted wholegrain preferment and a sourdough levain, similar to Peter Reinhardt&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Taking a page from all of the above, I started my heretical experiment a few days ago.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This bread turned out superbly moist and dense, like a liquidy L√§rabar. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe the knife came out clean! The scald worked out marvelously as a binder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First bite reminded me of a cocoa banana bread, which is weird because there was absolutely no banana or cocoa in it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s definitely not as decadent as &lt;em>il panforte di Siena&lt;/em>, but plenty sweet enough for me (I could eat 2 small slices at most in one sitting). I would definitely put a lot more nuts into it next time, and maybe reduce the amount of fruits.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Stanley Ginsberg has a recipe for &lt;em>zelten&lt;/em> in &lt;em>The Rye Baker&lt;/em>. No mention that it&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;em>hutzelbrot&lt;/em> by a different name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today is MLK Day in the US &amp;ndash; a federal holiday. I was looking for grains on some Swedish &lt;em>net butiker&lt;/em> this morning, and popped into a farm store statically built with Hugo (like this site you are reading right now). That&amp;rsquo;s a first and a breath of fresh air, given the virtually unassailable dominance by Shopify and Squarespace in e-commerce. It made me feel hopeful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about an anime I watched a long time ago &amp;ndash; &lt;em>Shinsekai yori&lt;/em> (Êñ∞‰∏ñÁïå„Çà„Çä / From the New World).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was just complaining the other day about how we had to drive increasingly longer and longer distances these days to get to a truly wild and natural park. More and more green space has been rezoned for residential housing development. Oftentimes I feel mankind has essentially been running a giant Ponzi scheme with Nature &amp;ndash; who might be &lt;a href="https://peaksurfer.blogspot.com/2022/12/who-is-sam-bankman-fried-of.html">the SBF of the ecological space&lt;/a>?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A person deals with the natural elements only through a set of technologies which is so complete that he is actually dealing with those technologies themselves. The natural environment itself disappears. We obviously have to make a comparison with the city, an essential product of technology. In the city, man perceives the natural elements only accidentally (parks, sidewalk trees). Nothing spontaneously natural is left here. And outside nature is reserved for spare time, relaxation, etc., given the decreasing importance of agriculture and the decline in the farming population.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Home prices have been falling&amp;hellip; 1 out of 3 real estate agents in the US couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to pay rent in November. But when you go to Zillow and actually check the price history of almost any house on the market right now, you will see that current price drop looks like &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/files/Kovach-statement.pdf">a pimple on an elephant&amp;rsquo;s ass&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo; The only good news is downpayment requirements are falling, too. Still, total cost of home ownership over a 25-year amortization is significantly higher. Few are advertising that fact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some quick mortgage math for Canadians: a C$1.5m mortgage at 3% APR with a 25-year amortization is C$86,141/year (C$2,151,545 total cost). A C$1.1m mortgage at 7% APR with a 25-year amortization is C$94,391/year (C$2,359,789 total cost). Housing prices need to drop a lot more.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Pending Home Sales in the United States decreased 37.80% year-on-year in November of 2022, the 18th straight month of declines and the biggest since November of 2021.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A ramification: Private Equity (PE) is going to see a massive write-down of its non-public assets in 2023, whether it&amp;rsquo;s residential real estate (RRE), commercial real estate (CRE), or venture capital (VC). Blackstone&amp;rsquo;s $68Bn &lt;a href="https://www.breit.com/portfolio/">BREIT&lt;/a> and Starwood&amp;rsquo;s $30Bn &lt;a href="https://www.starwoodnav.reit/portfolio/">SREIT&lt;/a> already froze withdrawals last month. This past week, BREIT got a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230103005410/en/UC-Investments-Creates-Strategic-Venture-with-Blackstone-to-Invest-4-Billion-in-BREIT-Common-Shares">$4Bn &amp;ldquo;Buffett-style&amp;rdquo; last-resort bailout&lt;/a> from the University of California. Given that Blackstone is the world largest institutional landlord, 2023 is off to an ominous start for the US CRE market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Markdowns will be severe. This will lead to groupthink of re-evaluating the entire PE world. Not all PE is bad, but the decade-long pyramiding of real estate on ever lower interest rates has ended &amp;ndash; and that will bring a big markdown cycle. Opportunity always exists when the crowd thinks it knows an unknowable future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another surprise file will be the Pension Fund Bailout Act of 2023. The City of Chicago is the poster child for this phenomenon, but they are not alone. Pension Funds (PFs) have been gouging on PE and RE over the last decade. That horse is now dead, as the return of real interest rates and above-zero commercial papers crushes the valuations of these investments. Slowly at first, and then all of a sudden, the markdowns will rip holes in the PF balance sheets. The fact that the bulk of the boomers are now retiring is not going to help these PFs. (The tight labor market is partly due to early retirements.) As this pull-forward effect ripples through the PF world, more problems will surface and the cry for a bailout will intensify. Good luck to the bond market and RE market when the buyer from the last decade is now a seller. Prepare for &amp;ldquo;higher for longer&amp;rdquo; in the interest rate world as the demand for commercial papers drops &amp;ndash; especially in a negative-carry world. The current bond yield curve is toxic for leveraged financial positions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of ridiculous things happened in the last couple of years, e.g. cars launched into space for the memes, degenerates becoming millionaires overnight from their basement and then giving it all back. As the calendar turns to 2023, all those moments will be lost in time, like tears in the rain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Dominoes are starting to fall, e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/01/05/silvergate-stock-crashes-nearly-50-as-bank-grapples-with-crypto-crisis/">Silvergate&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.amny.com/transit/ag-james-sues-auto-lender-credit-acceptance-corp-accuses-of-predatory-loans-and-securities-fraud/">Credit Acceptance Corporation&lt;/a> this past week. Bed Bath and Beyond is worried about &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/05/business/bed-bath-beyond-bankruptcy.html">a gloomier future&lt;/a>. &amp;ldquo;Slowly at first, then all of a sudden.&amp;rdquo; Second-tier financial institutions and sovereigns will be the trigger. The higher cost of capital is starting to filter into the financial economy, driving valuations lower and lower.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The layoffs in Tech Land are &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/05/amazon-to-cut-18000-jobs-as-tech-layoffs-continue/">just getting started&lt;/a>, as the seemingly unending stream of capital supporting profitless Ponzi tech is drying up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There has been too much money in finance and tech. There are some who can resist, but not many. Plenty of Harvard grads went on to Wall Street. What a waste. You need enough money to live, but how much is that? Which is precisely the point of &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15255876/">&lt;em>Emily the Criminal&lt;/em>&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; Emily needs the money and she makes choices. The middle class has evaporated. And the truth is those at the bottom will do anything to survive. Desperate people do desperate things. Emily says you must make your own rules. You are either the boss or the employee (capital vs. labor). If you are the employee, you don&amp;rsquo;t have much power. Sure, there are unions. Then again, everybody agrees to arbitration and the company always wins and&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Life is hard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet people can still splurge $140 on a dozen &lt;a href="https://lastcrumb.com/">luxury cookies&lt;/a> and $100 on a single panettone. First-class flights from Zurich to Singapore are fully booked. Channel 2.55 bag went from $1600 in 2008 to $9000 in 2022. More draining in the financial ecosystem is on tap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11564570/">&lt;em>Glass Onion&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, Benoit Blanc eventually figures out that the billionaire is just an idiot &amp;ndash; and he should have seen it all along.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thoroughly caffeinated, I skimmed through Micheline Maynard&amp;rsquo;s new book, &lt;em>Satisfaction Guaranteed: How Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s Built a Corner Deli into a Global Food Community&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those quintessential boomer hagiography-cum-business books. The author clearly admires Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash; almost as much as Kamala Harris publicly idolizes civil rights lawyers &amp;ndash; and keeps comparing it to the world&amp;rsquo;s most successful companies, especially Toyota; whereas I find the niche store&amp;rsquo;s business model more clich√©d than inspiring. The owners' purportedly unique &amp;ldquo;Visioning&amp;rdquo; process at ZingTrain, for example, recommends that your &amp;ldquo;effective vision&amp;rdquo; be &amp;ldquo;inspiring,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;strategically sound,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;written down,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;communicated&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; four tenets that, on the whole, seem pretty stale. The same could be said about Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;12 Natural Laws of Business,&amp;rdquo; which includes such banal points as &amp;ldquo;profit is good&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;greatness takes time.&amp;rdquo; One story I find particularly intriguing is how Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/uncategorized/campus-206/">handled competition&lt;/a> (e.g. Amer&amp;rsquo;s Mediterranean Deli) in the early years, given that 1) restaurant recipes are virtually never patentable, 2) restaurants have basically no &amp;ldquo;moats&amp;rdquo;, and 3) customer loyalty is fragile, particularly during difficult times. TBH, I find Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s mail-order bread a lot fresher than this book. Michigan has historically been hit hard by national recessions because the state&amp;rsquo;s economy (still) depends heavily on the auto industry and durable goods manufacturing, despite recent efforts to diversify. It would be interesting to see what happens in this round.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are only patterns. Patterns on top of patterns. Patterns that affect other patterns. Patterns hidden by patterns. Patterns within patterns. If you watch closely, history does nothing but repeat itself. What we call chaos is just patterns we haven&amp;rsquo;t recognized. What we call random is just patterns we can&amp;rsquo;t decipher. What we call nonsense is just patterns we can&amp;rsquo;t understand. What we call gibberish is just patterns we can&amp;rsquo;t read.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I made a bread inspired by German baker Tobias Exner&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Brandenburger Urkraft&lt;/em>, which he created together with Olympic canoe champion Sebastian Brendel.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="bran-levain">Bran levain&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I milled some heritage Sangaste rye (45%), Red Fife wheat (45%), and buckwheat (10%).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I bolted the freshly milled wholegrain flours to remove some course bits (~17%), which I fed to the levain (~85% hydration) in 3 increments over 14 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sifted flours came out to be ~83% extraction. Every part of the grain will be re-combined in the final dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="altus-soaker">Altus soaker&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I toasted a piece of day-old sourdough rye bread and ground it into breadcrumbs. I scooped some of the breadcrumbs (15% of final flour weight) into a bowl and poured an equal amount of hot water over it.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>I mixed the sifted flours, chia and flax seeds, and the altus soaker with 85% of the water, and left the mixture to autolyze for 30 mins. Then I added the levain and salt, and mixed for a few minutes. I let the dough rest for 10 mins, before adding the rest of the water slowly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, I put the dough in the fridge. In the next 24 hours, I took the dough out of the fridge 6 times and gave it a coil-fold, adding some of the sprouted pseudo-grains, toasted seeds and raisins during each fold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a 24-hour cold fermentation in the fridge, I shaped the dough, rolled it in extra sunflower seeds, and let it proof at room temperature for 3 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly, I baked it as usual, in my toaster oven.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I like the bread toasted, and paired with Kentucky old-school country ham.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year, I hope to bake with more varieties of heritage grains. I would like to go into the woods more often and get to know more native plants before they disappear for good. And maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll try growing some peppers, too.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>

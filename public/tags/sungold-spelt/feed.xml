Irresistible and toothsome.</description><content>&lt;p>The US is still a superlulz &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jit.asp">JIT&lt;/a> la la land. One bullet is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/04/1140647869/power-substations-north-carolina-gunfire-vandalism">all it takes&lt;/a> to shut down the power grid for days&amp;hellip;possibly weeks. It reminded me of Juan Zarate&amp;rsquo;s memoir, &lt;em>Treasury&amp;rsquo;s War.&lt;/em> Unlike Europe, Uncle Sam is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance. Still, it feels like a first-world country with third-world infrastructure. As much as it sucks for the people affected, we are all living in an age of energy vulnerability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been to various parts of North freakin' Carolina a number of times. Charlotte, like any other financial center, is the most boring. The Research Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill) in the heart of Piedmont is more fun. Of course, nothing beats Asheville &amp;ndash; a hipster mecca. Best memories are licking my fingers after eating N&amp;rsquo;Asheville &amp;ldquo;Mount St. Hell No&amp;rdquo; spicy crispy fried chicken at &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE5SyITVOTE">Rocky&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a>, and getting caught in a rainstorm in Wilmington on the riverwalk and roaming the beaches like a drowned rat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until recently that I learned North Carolina is the #1 producer of sweet potatoes in the US.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week I stumbled across a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/udoyzj/pain_depices_au_levain_naturally_leavened_french/">reddit&lt;/a> on &lt;em>pain d&amp;rsquo;√©pices au levain&lt;/em>, got sidetracked, and went down a rabbit hole. I still have a ton of sweet potatoes left over from the Gobble Gobble Day. Why not create a &lt;em>pain d&amp;rsquo;√©pices&lt;/em> of my own, you know, heresy style? Maybe with a North Carolina character? Forgive me, France.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="homemade-spiced-syrup">Homemade spiced syrup&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>First off, I made a simple &lt;em>sirop d&amp;rsquo;√©pices&lt;/em> in the Instant Pot:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>60g aged orange peels&lt;/li>
&lt;li>30g fresh ginger&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 whole star anise&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 piece 4&amp;quot; cinnamon stick&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5 cloves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 allspice berries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>10 cardamom seeds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g raisin water (soak 150g raisins in 250g water for a few hours, and squeeze out the liquid)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g h‚ÇÇo&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Pressure-cooked for 1 minute, followed by 30 minutes of natural release. Then I left it overnight, to allow the aromatics to meld together further. The sweet orangey aroma wafted through the house. Next morning, I strained the whole mixture through a through a fine-mesh sieve, and filled up 2 big jars with the thin brown goodness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This homemade syrup packs quite a punch with its fragrant combination of spices. Delightfully sweet with a deep orange flavor, and chock full of bold, brisk notes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Pro tip&lt;/code>: Instead of throwing away the leftover aromatic pulp from straining, blend it finely into a sweet fruit paste. Use it as a delicious spread on toasts, or thin it a little and use as a marinade/sauce/glaze in savory dishes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="tar-heel-blend">Tar Heel Blend&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I decided to mix up my own Tar Heel Blend wheat flour, instead of using my go-to workhorse Turkey Red.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>60% Appalachian White (Fish Pond Branch Farms, NC): a HWWW with a mild creamy taste and ~12% protein&lt;/li>
&lt;li>20% NuEast (Fish Pond Branch Farms, NC): a HRWW with a delicate nutty flavor and ~10% protein&lt;/li>
&lt;li>20% Sungold spelt (Red Tail Grains, NC): a modern cultivar of spelt with ~12% protein&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Much like Missouri, the eastern US is not hospitable to growing bread wheat, because the area&amp;rsquo;s humidity increases the incidence of disease in the fields and affects yield and quality of the grain. Historically, North Carolina has grown almost exclusively soft wheats (lower protein, better for crackers, biscuits, etc). But, in response to a growing demand from the resurgence of artisan bakeries, two modern high-yielding cultivars of hard winter wheat, Appalachian White and NuEast, were bred by NC State researchers and &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2009/ars-releases-first-hard-winter-wheat-varieties-for-eastern-us-production/">released in 2009&lt;/a> to farmers as high-quality bread wheats suited for production in the Carolinas.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>I let it ferment (for ~18 hours at 65F) until it got loose and bubbly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="final-dough">Final dough&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>While the levain is fermenting, cook the sweet potatoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want your sweet potatoes sweeter, cook them &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-mashed-sweet-potatoes-recipe">low and slow&lt;/a>, so that the enzyme will have more time to break down more starch and convert it to more maltose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I heated a pot of plain water in an Instant Pot to ~160F, and threw a few whole Carolina Ruby sweet potatoes directly into it. I covered up the pot, and let the spuds rest in the warm water bath overnight. You want to hold the sweet spuds in that 135F-170F (57C-77C) sweet spot for an extended period of time, to activate their endogenous enzymes that bring out their natural sweetness. After a few hours, you can take the sweet spuds out of the water bath, roast and mash them.&lt;/p>

&lt;td>12%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>I squished up the flour with 1/2 of the spiced syrupy water and the cooled sweet potato, and autolyzed for 2 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the autolyse, I squeezed all of the levain into the dough, while adding 1/2 of the remaining sweet water in several increments. Gave it a few rounds of slap &amp;amp; fold until it reached a semi-homogeneous texture, to make sure everything was evenly incorproated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a 20-minute rest, I squished in the salt and the rest of the sweet water. The dough looked and felt like a sticky mess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did a coil-fold every 20 minutes for the first hour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the 2h mark, I added the chocolate pieces, and gave the dough another coil-fold so that all of the chocolate bits were completely enveloped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did two more coil-folds at the 3h and 4h marks, respectively, to make sure the chocolate goodies were totally distributed throughout the dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dough started to feel puffy. I decided to stop turning it, and let it ferment, unmolested, in the sunroom overnight (~43F).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next morning, the dough had doubled in volume. I let it warm up on the kitchen counter for 2 hours. Then I shaped it into a boule and placed it in a proofing bowl, seam-side down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the surface of the dough reached ~60F, I dumped it out onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper, and baked it in the toaster oven. 350F for the first 20 minutes, and 325F for 20 more minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I let the bread cool for 4 hours before slicing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bread surrounding the little nuggets of chocolate was not bland at all! It was ever so gently sweetened by the simple syrup, like everything was magically pulled together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crumb was tender and springy, the sweetish flavor in harmony with the chocolate and spices; the crust was crispy and fabulous. Another winner for my repertoire!&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Harpy's Lovesong</title><link>/posts/harpys-lovesong/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 19:22:12 -0600</pubDate><guid>/posts/harpys-lovesong/</guid><description>A magical multigrain bread.</description><content>&lt;p>The first time I tasted naturally leavened bread was in April 2014, in Athens, Georgia. I was hitting a low point in life. A friend brought me a loaf of multigrain bread from &lt;a href="https://www.independentbaking.com/">Independent Baking Co.&lt;/a>, a new bakery in the heart of Five Points.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the faintest idea what sourdough was, but that loaf of bread &amp;ndash; dark caramel-colored crackly crusts enrobed a cream-colored nutty crumb, with a slight tang and a satisfying flavor &amp;ndash; cheered me up somehow and remained etched in my memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This bread is an attempt to recreate that magical warm moment.&lt;/p>

A kaleidoscope of fun flavors.</description><content>&lt;p>I love &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> (ÊäπËå∂), which is basically powdered green tea. Like anything in life, it&amp;rsquo;s an acquired taste. I hated bitter beers when I first tried them, but now I love the likes of Chimay Cinq Cents and Stone Ruination. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never had &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> before, you will likely not love it the first time you try it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how is &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> different from other green teas, you ask? Well, first of all, it differs in the preparation process. Most teas are infused with water and the leaves are strained out and discarded, whereas &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> is actually whisked into hot water, i.e. the tea leaves are consumed directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> actually goes through extra processes during cultivation compared to the general category of green tea usually referred to as &lt;em>sencha&lt;/em> (ÁÖéËå∂, steamed, rolled, and dried green tea leaves). Once the buds of the &lt;em>Camellia sinensis&lt;/em> tea leaves start to sprout, the entire crop is kept in the shade for about a month before harvesting. This slows down the rate of photosynthesis, increasing the amount of chlorophyll in the leaves. In the end, this produces a tea leaf with a sweet flavor and bold &lt;em>umami&lt;/em>. Lastly, the steamed and then thoroughly dried tea leaves are meticulously ground on a stone mill into a fine powder. This powder form is what makes it possible to add a concentrated green tea flavor to many products.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Chinese were the first to grow and grind green tea. However, the Japanese were the ones who invented the method of creating &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> as we know it today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Japanese tea cultivation started when a 12th-century monk named Myouan Eisai (ÊòéËè¥Ê†ÑË•ø) brought green tea seeds &amp;ndash; along with the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism &amp;ndash; from China and planted them on Mt. Sefuri. In addition, he gave tea seeds to Myoue Shounin (ÊòéÊÅµ‰∏ä‰∫∫), a monk from Kousan-ji temple (È´òÂ±±ÂØ∫) in Toganoo (Ê†ÇÂ∞æ), Kyoto. Shounin planted the seeds near the temple and &amp;ndash; voil√†! &amp;ndash; this was the start of Uji tea. Oh, Eisai also wrote a book about tea, called Kissa Yojoki (Âñ´Ëå∂È§äÁîüË®ò), often translated as &amp;ldquo;How to Stay Healthy by Drinking Tea.&amp;rdquo; The book begins with &amp;ldquo;Tea is the ultimate mental and medical remedy and has the ability to make one‚Äôs life more full and complete‚Äù.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a long time, only the nobility and upper echelons of the Japanese society drank green tea. It was not until the Meiji Restoration at the end of the 19th century that the cultivation, consumption and preparation of green tea became widespread in Japan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Modern Japan has developed the most advanced and refined industry for the cultivation of a few varieties of green tea. Furthermore, it&amp;rsquo;s the world&amp;rsquo;s second largest green tea producer after China. As green tea became more popular in the West over the last two decades, China has begun to produce more and more of its own &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>matcha&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; under &amp;ldquo;simulated&amp;rdquo; Japanese farming conditions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like wine grapes, the quality and growth of green tea are greatly affected by the region&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>terroir&lt;/em>. Being Japan&amp;rsquo;s oldest and most famous green tea region means Uji is inevitably a hot spot for tea tourism. People love to visit Kyoto tea country&amp;rsquo;s traditional tea shops and modern tea emporiums, stroll through rolling hills of tea fields, and sample a variety of teas. I know people who have travelled to Uji, Japan to taste &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> and still feel only so-so about it. Lol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a Japanese proverb that says &amp;ldquo;good medication is bitter in taste&amp;rdquo; (ËâØËñ¨„ÅØÂè£„Å´Ëã¶„Åó), and &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> is one of them. Matcha has a unique, complex taste. It&amp;rsquo;s slightly bitter, with a sweet aftertaste; it&amp;rsquo;s buttery and nutty, with a seaweedy undertone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David&amp;rsquo;s Tea &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> is a good place to start, although it&amp;rsquo;s likely not the best &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> that you&amp;rsquo;ll ever have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One way to enjoy the mild bitterness of &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> more is to add it to baked goods. Baking enhances the rich aroma of the &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em>, and that&amp;rsquo;s why there are gazillion forms of &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em>-flavored baked goods in Asia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this bread, I selected flours from below the Mason Dixon line. The American South is synonymous with sweet tea, and South Carolina remains the only US state that commercially produces tea on a large scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Generally, soft wheats have a high starch yield on milling and a low protein content. They are grown in areas of high rainfall and lower soil fertility, primarily east of the Mississippi River. Low-protein southern flours are deployed to their best advantage in their growing region&amp;rsquo;s specialties-biscuits, pies, and cakes where tenderness is prized over strength. Beyond wheat&amp;rsquo;s given genetic quotient of hardness or softness, environmental conditions determine the hardness of any given crop. Not only the overall protein content but also the quality and specific amounts of each protein present can be affected by seasonal variations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Wheats grown in the South generally aren&amp;rsquo;t very strong. This bread is another reminder to pay attention to the quality and property of ingredients grown in a particular region.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> I used here is Marukyu-Koyamaen &lt;em>aoarashi matcha&lt;/em> (‰∏∏‰πÖÂ∞èÂ±±Âúí„ÅÆÊäπËå∂ÈùíÂµê). It&amp;rsquo;s an entry-grade &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> with intense flavors &amp;ndash; better for baking than sipping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3% &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> may seem too little, but &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> is only consumed about 1-2g at a time. &lt;em>Usucha&lt;/em> (ËñÑËå∂), the common &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> preparation, usually calls for 1 tsp/2g of &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> per 70-80ml of water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everyday/ceremonial (not cooking) &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> is usually made from high-grade &lt;em>gyokuro&lt;/em> (ÁéâÈú≤), not &lt;em>sencha&lt;/em>. But for cooking &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em>, you don&amp;rsquo;t need such high grade. You could technically make your own at home, by pulverizing some high-quality green tea leaves in a coffee grinder and sifting a few times to get a fine powder. It&amp;rsquo;s totally fine in lattes, smoothies and baked goods. Some heresy right here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, wtf is &lt;em>genmaicha&lt;/em> and why did I use it instead of plain h‚ÇÇo? Well, &lt;em>genmaicha&lt;/em> (ÁéÑÁ±≥Ëå∂) is basically a Japanese popcorn tea: a blend of roasted puffed brown rice and &lt;em>sencha&lt;/em>. You taste green tea and popcorn at the same time &amp;ndash; the best of both worlds!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted a robust green tea flavor in this bread. That&amp;rsquo;s why I brewed a pot of Ippodo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>genmaicha&lt;/em> and soaked the flour in the cooled tea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rouge de Bordeaux was the OG baguette wheat from the Bordeaux region of France. It gained popularity in the 19th century among artisan bakers who loved the smooth, mellow flavor, aroma of spices, and robust performance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Spelt is an ancient wheat with a golden color and notes of honey and fresh hay. It&amp;rsquo;s quite versatile &amp;ndash; strong enough for bread and pasta, but delicate enough for pastry doughs, cakes and cookies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just mix everything together, and leave them in two separate containers in the fridge overnight. Yes, overnight autolyse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously, the green dough is going to be the stronger sibling and do most of the heavy-lifting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next day, I let them warm up to room temperature before adding 40% ripe levain and 2% salt. The green dough was very extensible and easy to work with. The cocoa dough, not so much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I laminated both &lt;em>p√¢tes&lt;/em> together and added 10% toasted walnuts and 20% dried fruits (raisins, dates, and jujubes).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dough went through 4 hours of bulk fermentation at room temperature with 3 folds, and had ~50% rise in volume before preshaping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2 hours of warm proof in a loaf pan before baking. Fantastic oven spring.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Cooled overnight and sliced next morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bread turned out less airy than I expected. The &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> turned out more hydroscopic than I thought it would be, and the green &lt;em>p√¢te&lt;/em> was a little too taut. Next time I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely increase the hydration. The green tea flavor was noticeable but mellow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crumb was tender, moist, and mildly chewy. A taster said the sweet fruity aroma immediately reminded him of spiced apple cider!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This one was a lot of fun to eat: one bite tasted tart like a granny smith apple, the next bite was reminiscent of a &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/shinsekai-ambrosia/">L√§rabar&lt;/a>, yet the next brought to mind mocha, nougat, hazelnut&amp;hellip; A kaleidoscope of flavors.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p>Key West, the southernmost point of the continental US, is one of my favorite summer spots. Ernest Hemingway once said Key West was &amp;ldquo;a St. Tropez of the poor.&amp;rdquo; He came for a day and ended up staying for a decade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The island is still a source of endless joy: fishing, scuba diving, dancing, slumming, and drinking. The most beautiful thing about Key West is spending the night on the beach (not the best in Florida), swimming there as if it were daytime, and tanning, like vampires, under the moonlight. And I always like to bring &lt;em>medianoches&lt;/em> and &lt;em>chicharones&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time, I drank lots of corn. First of all, a fermented &lt;em>chicha morada&lt;/em> (I can&amp;rsquo;t stand the sweet and fruity non-fermented version), made with Peruvian purple corn, pineapple, apples, lime, and spices. It tasted like a &lt;em>kombucha&lt;/em>. Next, a &lt;em>chicha venezolana&lt;/em>, which turned out more like a Mexican &lt;em>horchata&lt;/em>. On my way out, I drank homemade &lt;em>chicha de jora&lt;/em> and ate &lt;em>estofado de carne&lt;/em> (rich and flavorful beef stew with garden vegetables and &lt;em>chicha de jora&lt;/em>); the stew reminded me of &lt;em>b≈ìuf bourguignon&lt;/em> and was a lot better than this Ohio &amp;ldquo;delicacy&amp;rdquo; called Cincinnati chili 3-way I had earlier at Skyline just outside Fort Lauderdale, which is a pound of shredded cheese on top of mediocre chili on top of poorly cooked spaghetti.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These brought back good memories of backpacking in Peru and eating at &lt;em>picanter√≠as&lt;/em>, where &lt;em>chicha morada&lt;/em> and &lt;em>chicha de jora&lt;/em> are commonly brewed in-house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Chicha&lt;/em> is an ancient pre-Columbian corn drink widespread in the Andes. It was absolutely essential to the Incas; for them it was a fundamental domestic product, traded from coast to inland, up and down the continent. &lt;em>Chicha&lt;/em> was a community necessity, a ritual libation, an imperative social lubricant to the Incas' communication with the gods, a drink worthy of being sipped by a farmer straight out of a clay pot as well as lapped up by the sun itself out of a gold vessel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The brewing process for &lt;em>chicha&lt;/em> is essentially &lt;a href="https://beerconnoisseur.com/articles/chicha-bolivias-tart-beer">similar&lt;/a> to that of European-style beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Do√±a Leonor Mariscal, 70 years old, does just that for her fellow villagers. In her tiny ramshackle building, once a chicheria itself, she steeps the corn and lets it germinate a bit on a large piece of cloth laid out in the sun, directly on the cobblestone street in front of her building. The sun is sometimes hot enough to dry out her corn malt, but she admits to using ashes sometimes to complete the process. She then bags the malt and lets the area chicha brewers grind this corn into a flour at their own breweries. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fermentation therefore seems to be nearly entirely carried out by the natural content of the corn. Many traditional cochabambina brewers like Do√±a Narcissa do not seem aware that the lactic acid bacteria contained within the corn is the true origin of the alcohol, light fizz and acidic flavor of their brew. But what matters is that they are always able to quench chicha lovers' thirst for delicate tartness; the science behind their brewing methods isn&amp;rsquo;t a major concern.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Outside Latin America, the one thing most people remember about &lt;em>chicha&lt;/em> is that it&amp;rsquo;s often fermented with human saliva. In particular, &lt;em>chicha de jora&lt;/em> (&lt;em>jora&lt;/em> is a specific kind of yellow maize) is typically prepared by chewing said corn into a clump before fermenting it into a boozy concoction. Since the starch in corn is well locked into the grain kernel and thus unavailable for fermentation on its own, chewing allows the enzymes (e.g. amylases) in your mouth to break down the starch into sugar.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The chewing inevitably raises many eyebrows. The idea of consuming a drink brewed from someone else&amp;rsquo;s saliva is viscerally disturbing, particularly in the post-COVID era. Using saliva as a fermentation starter is not unique to South America, however; there&amp;rsquo;s evidence that chewing as a way of kicking off fermentation was practiced in prehistoric Europe before the emergence of malting; Finnish folklore tells the legend of a woman by the name of Kalevatar, who invented beer by mixing honey with bear saliva; some traditional Japanese &lt;em>sakes&lt;/em>, such as &lt;em>kuchikamizake&lt;/em> (Âè£Âôõ„ÅøÈÖí, meaning &amp;ldquo;mouth-chewed &lt;em>sake&lt;/em>&amp;quot;), are made from chewed rice; and &lt;em>kava&lt;/em>, produced by the peoples of the Pacific Islands from chewing the roots of kava (aka. &lt;em>Piper methysticum G. Forst&lt;/em>), was born in this way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fetishes and aesthetics aside, saliva contains diverse microbiomes, and each person&amp;rsquo;s saliva is different and therefore gives different flavors to the fermented product.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been smitten with grain corns. You may remember the loaf of &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-4/">blue corn bread&lt;/a> I made with East Coast ale yeast a few weeks ago. This time, inspired by the wonderful Peruvian corn dishes and drinks I had in Key West, I&amp;rsquo;d like to up the corn percentage and make a Portuguese-style &lt;em>broa de milho&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="corn-mash">Corn mash&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some brewers have described dealing with malted corn as &amp;ldquo;pure, unadulterated pain from hell&amp;rdquo; that comes in many folds:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Malted corn has low diastatic power &amp;ndash; barely 35 ¬∞L. That&amp;rsquo;s hardly enough to fully convert itself, and requires exogenous amylase from either malted barley or powdered additive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Corn has a higher gelatinization temperature than barley to break apart the starch molecules. Boiling corn would do the trick. However, high temperatures will kill those natural enzymes meant to convert the starches to fermentable sugars.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Also, while corncobs as a whole do have husks, the corn kernels do not contain husks, making lautering comparable to the 9th layer of hell. Luckily, this challenge doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in solid beer (aka. bread).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Undermodifed malts, including corn, have dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in spades, so when you combine the two you may develop unpleasant off-flavors if the proper precautions aren&amp;rsquo;t taken.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>You know, none of this sounds that excruciating to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you really are a single-malt purist, you will&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>chew the corn to break it into smaller bits for the mash and add the enzymes from your saliva that will break down the starches to sugars; or&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>go through European-style triple-decoction mashing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you aren&amp;rsquo;t that much of a purist, then you need to add exogenous enzymes. One way is to add dry amylase powder; another is to use some pale barley malt to get the enzymes.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I wanted to do the single-malt triple-decoction mashing, because mashing is fun and I had never done an all-corn mash before.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>ingredient&lt;/th>
&lt;th>%&lt;/th>
&lt;th>weight&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>yellow corn malt (Grouse Malt House)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>100%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>375g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>tap water&lt;/td>
&lt;td>87.2%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>327g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Total: 702g&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since maize doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain large amounts of phytase, acid rest isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started the mixture at ~125¬∞F where I left it for 2 hours (protein rest). Then I decocted 1/3 of the mash and boiled it for 2 minutes. I tasted a small sample of the decoction &amp;ndash; it was insanely sweet, and reminded me of a Southern cornbread but slightly more starchy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a few minutes, I added the boiled decoction back to the main mash and it raised the temperature to 150¬∞F. I held the mash at ~150¬∞F for the next 5 hours, turning the stove top burner on occasionally to keep the temperature consistent. Further sweetness didn&amp;rsquo;t begin to manifest until the end of it, with plenty of residual starchiness. So I decocted 1/3 of the mash again, and boiled for 2 minutes; when I returned the decoction to the main mash, it brought up the temperature to 158¬∞F, where I left it for another 2.5 hours. Lastly, I decocted 1/3 of the mash again, raising the temperature of the main mash to 168¬∞F &amp;ndash; and held it there for 1 hour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After all that, starch was no longer perceivable to my tongue. The saccharified corn mash had the fragrance of sweet corn cookies, with intriguing background notes of chestnuts. It tasted insanely sweet and malty, and had a distinct caramelized corn flavor &amp;ndash; almost like a corn muffin. I quite enjoyed the mash, and honestly could have devoured it as is (like a breakfast porridge or dessert).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="corn-barm">Corn barm&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once the saccharified corn mash had cooled off to body temperature, I measured 150g out into a separate bowl for yeast inoculation, reserving the remaining 552g in the fridge until needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>

&lt;tr>

&lt;td>1.5g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Total: 151.5g&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Framgarden expresses a tropical profile with lots of pineapple leading the way and subtler notes of hay and white pepper in the background.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Escarpment&amp;rsquo;s recommended temperature range for Framgarden is quite wide (68-95¬∞F). I let the inoculated mash ferment, loosely covered, at 80-85¬∞F for 12 hours.&lt;/p>

&lt;tr>
&lt;td>London Tropics liquid yeast (Berkeley Yeast)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>100%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>75g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Total: 150g (100% extraction = whole grain)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mixed the wholegrain rye flour with the yeast slurry until thoroughly hydrated, and let the mixture ferment (loosely covered) at ~68¬∞F for 12 hours. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect this to biotransform or ferment much &amp;ndash; it was more of a soaker (√† la Peter Reinhart&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Whole Grain Breads&lt;/em>) that utilized excess liquid yeast, in this case, to thoroughly hydrate the whole grains and enhance flavors in the final bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh boy, biotransformation kicked off as soon as I mixed everything together; the artificial fruit aroma didn&amp;rsquo;t get as overwhelming as in my first &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">POG bomb&lt;/a>, but very noticeable. I started to regret underestimating this &amp;ldquo;weapon of mass thiolization&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After ~12 hours, the soaker showed slight signs of fermentation and smelled pungently fruity &amp;ndash; Mr. Fusion-powered DeLorean time machine was back in full stride. A hyperrealistic simulacrum. A hallucinatory fantasy. It reminded me of a quote from Jean Baudrillard:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What every society looks for in continuing to produce, and to overproduce, is to restore the real that escapes it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Interestingly, Untitled Art in Waunakee, WI just released a &lt;a href="https://www.drinkuntitled.com/product/non-alcoholic-berliner-weisse/">non-alcoholic &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em>&lt;/a> brewed with London Tropics, de-alcoholized with membrane filtration technologies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since thiols are more soluble in alcohols than in water, doesn&amp;rsquo;t the filtration remove quite a bit of the thiols as well? I wonder how much of the fruity aroma/flavor from Tropics remains in the NA beer. As far as I know, de-alcoholization generally removes the fermentation products &amp;ndash; which can be added back in, but that process can be pretty violent to the flavor structure of the beer and, most notably, quite expensive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t arrested fermentation (e.g. interrupting full attenuation) with Tropics make more sense in producing NA beers? In my bread experiments, London Tropics kicks off biotransformation waaaay before attenuation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>(100% extraction = whole grain)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mixed all of the ingredients together into a homogeneous dough, and let it ferment at ~73¬∞F for 2 hours. Then I shaped it into a &lt;em>boule&lt;/em>, and placed it in a proofing colander liberally coated with toasted oat bran. The dough was left to proof at ~58¬∞F for 14 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I got the BBQ grill to 400¬∞F, I flipped the dough into a cast-iron skillet and slid it onto the grill. I added black walnut shells to the bottom of the grill, closed the lid, and let the bread bake at 400¬∞F for 1 hour.‚Å†&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Summer is a completely different experience when you know how to grill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crust came out thick, smoky, charred, and crunchy; the inside moist and tender, plush with a flavor that absolutely reverberated with corn. Mouthfuls of smokiness, too. The tropical fruit profile got subdued by the wonderful smoky flavor of open-fire bakery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s that perfect, forever corn bread that I want to bring to the beach. The summer wish I never knew I had.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This corn bread went so well with summer salads and snacky things. I took it to a park today, along with some butter (not optional), and enjoyed the hell out of it under a tree, while watching the clouds float across the sky.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m surprised how many people watch only HBO and whatever the Netflix algorithm recommends. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like the folks who email me asking factual questions &amp;ndash; have they never heard of the internet? There&amp;rsquo;s a vast cornucopia of streaming series out there; if you pick the right one, your life will be enhanced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last night I watched the final two episodes of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farzi">Farzi&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; while licking a plate of buttery &lt;a href="https://authenticsimplifiedrecipes.wordpress.com/2019/02/21/pav-bhaji/">&lt;em>pav bhaji&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. When the show was over, I spontaneously exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;That was great!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Frankly, not as great as &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bureau_(TV_series)">&lt;em>Le Bureau des L√©gendes&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2324587/">&lt;em>Poƒçivali u miru&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, but really fulfilling. And it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find those shows these days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Farzi&amp;rdquo; is about the rigid caste system in India, where upward mobility is extremely limited. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t dream. Opportunities are closed. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you&amp;rsquo;re not smart or willful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most people are so addicted to brands (e.g. HBO or Apple TV+). They watch only light stuff like comedy; they say real life is daunting enough, they don&amp;rsquo;t want to be brought down by a show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s what life is all about: new experiences, stretching your horizons, because otherwise you&amp;rsquo;d end up living on repeats, waiting to die.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with uncommon grains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wheat has been the hegemony in the bread world, while barley reigns supreme in the brewing industry. Malt has become synonymous with barley the way that flour has with wheat, but malt can be made from any type of (pseudo)grain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="buckwheat">Buckwheat&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The only exposure most people in the West have to buckwheat is in pancakes, which is quite sad.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Buckwheat (&lt;em>Fagopyrum sagittatum syn. F. esculentum&lt;/em>) is a curious and misunderstood food. It&amp;rsquo;s not a &amp;ldquo;wheat&amp;rdquo;, but is treated like one. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a shrub, related to rhubarb; it produces seeds on the flower heads. These seeds (or kernels) are what get ground into flour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like other seeds, buckwheat is high in both protein (18% by weight!) and fiber, but it&amp;rsquo;s unique among the seeds we typically eat, because it&amp;rsquo;s mainly composed of carbs, with lower fat and higher starch content than, say, sunflower seeds or chia seeds. IMO, buckwheat has a well-balanced starch, protein, fat, and mineral composition, and is absolutely delicious. Hands-down one of my favorite &amp;ldquo;cereals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buckwheat was long thought to have originated in central Asia, somewhere between Lake Baikal and Manchuria. Recent &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02861199">research&lt;/a> now leans toward southwest China and the Himalayan region as the center of origin. The two cultivated species of buckwheat, &lt;em>Fagopyrum esculentum&lt;/em> (common buckwheat) and &lt;em>Fagopyrum tataricum&lt;/em> (tartary buckwheat) are Chinese domesticates, presumably originating in upland southwest China, outside the major rice and millet centers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buckwheat is known as &lt;em>grano saraceno&lt;/em> in Italian and &lt;em>sarrasin&lt;/em> in French, leading the late food writer Waverly Root to assume that buckwheat originated in Asia Minor and was introduced by either the Turks, the Crusaders, and/or the Moors to places in Europe where other grains didn&amp;rsquo;t grow well and where the people ate &amp;ldquo;robustly&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; such as Brittany, Finland, Styria, central France and the Tyrolian Alps. Europeans of the Middle Ages, however, used the term &amp;ldquo;saracen&amp;rdquo; to describe many things that simply came from the East, whether they were Arabian or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the contemporary Italian botanist Valerio Giacomini, who has made a thorough study of buckwheat, there are three possible ways buckwheat arrived in Europe:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>through southern Russia, Poland, and Germany &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Belgium and France;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>through Turkey &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Greece, Hungary, and southern Russia; and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>through the maritime contacts of Venice, which might explain in part the ascription of &amp;ldquo;saracen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There is a legend that Joos van Ghistele brought it back with him from his journey to the Holy Land in 1485. Who knows. In any case, the origin of buckwheat is unknown, even if its name in Latin languages suggests an Arab provenance. The plant&amp;rsquo;s English name, &amp;ldquo;buckwheat&amp;rdquo;, came from the Dutch word for &amp;ldquo;beech&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em>boec&lt;/em>) and wheat, because it can be used in food, like wheat.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>What seems certain, though, is that buckwheat has been a traditional food around the world, particularly in regions with short growing seasons and poor soil. Eastern Europeans eat a porridge of toasted buckwheat groats (&lt;em>kasha&lt;/em>). In the mountainous valley of Lombardy, Italy, a traditional winter dish is &lt;em>pizzoccheri&lt;/em>, basically short buckwheat pasta tossed with butter, cabbage, cheese, garlic, and sage &amp;ndash; a poor &amp;ldquo;peasant&amp;rdquo; tradition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buckwheat has a rich history in the United States as well, unlike other ancient grains. It was common during the Colonial era, but began to decline in popularity after the Civil War ended.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I had the good fortune of experimenting with some caramel buckwheat malt from &lt;a href="https://grousemalthouse.com/">Grouse Malt House&lt;/a>, a dedicated gluten-free craft malthouse in Wellington, Colorado. (I was not looking for gluten-free alternatives &lt;em>per se&lt;/em>, but rather malts made from uncommon grains. Grouse has been crafting a ton of those since ~2013.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dark, triangular-shaped hulls covering the buckwheat seeds are left on, to help brewers lauter/filter more easily. The hull is very tough, but is edible when ground and provides a good source of fiber. Even after soaking and boiling, though, unhulled buckwheat is too chewy and too earthy for most people&amp;rsquo;s palates.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This malt, out of the box, smelled like a forest right after a rain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buckwheat can be milled with or without the hull. The traditional method is milling with the hulls. And yes, some millers even add extra hulls. Flour ground from unhulled buckwheat will be greyish, with tiny black specks &amp;ndash; it looks darker and tastes a tad stronger than flour made from hulled buckwheat (groats).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When freshly ground, this caramel buckwheat malt has an unmistakable earthy aroma &amp;ndash; it creates a woodsy vibe that&amp;rsquo;s bold but not overly aggressive, evoking mental imagery of a deep, verdant forest. There&amp;rsquo;s also a little sunflower seed-like nutty aroma. It tastes predominantly earthy &amp;ndash; like unmalted buckwheat or yellow split peas &amp;ndash; with a hint of malty sweetness. Just how I like my buckwheat, despite the lack of a quintessential &amp;ldquo;caramel&amp;rdquo; malt vibe.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Many Westerners don&amp;rsquo;t like that robust flavor of unhulled buckwheat. So there&amp;rsquo;s a large market for buckwheat flour &lt;em>sans&lt;/em> the hulls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know pretty well how buckwheat performs and tastes in food, but in beer? I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure. Enzymatic activities are &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228618138_The_Impact_of_Kilning_on_Enzymatic_Activity_of_Buckwheat_Malt">found&lt;/a> to be low in pale buckwheat malt. I would probably agree with what &lt;a href="https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/buckwheat-questions.449416/#post-5789674">this brewer&lt;/a> said about buckwheat:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I suspect that you will be disappointed with the flavor and diastatic power of pale-malt buckwheat, though. If my experience with Colorado Malting Company&amp;rsquo;s buckwheat malt is any indicator, about the only way to coax any flavor out of it is to make crystal malt; but even that doesn&amp;rsquo;t do much, considering very little saccharification takes place during the crystal-making process so you don&amp;rsquo;t get much in the way of caramelized sugars. The only use I have for buckwheat in my beers is unmalted as an adjunct to improve head retention (the malted stuff doesn&amp;rsquo;t do as well in that regard due to changes in protein contents), or else roasted really dark, as a stand-in for Briess &amp;ldquo;Midnight Wheat&amp;rdquo; to impart a smooth roast character to darker beers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Which is why I picked &amp;ldquo;caramel&amp;rdquo; buckwheat malt, not the other two buckwheat options (BK1001 pale and BK1100 roasted) offered by Grouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Caramel malt is typically made from &amp;ldquo;green malt&amp;rdquo; (wet germinated malt) or rehydrated base malt, mashed at 140-160¬∞F so that the amylase in each individual grain kernel degrades the starch within into simple sugars, and subsequently dried out at &amp;gt;=170¬∞F, which causes the sugars inside the malt to crystallize. It also causes the sugars and nitrogen-based compounds (mostly amino acids and proteins) to combine to form melanoidins. The major variable in the process is the kilning temperature, which determines the depth of the color and the degree of caramelization. The higher the drying temperature, the darker the color will be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During roasting, most (if not all) of the enzymes in the malt become denatured, and many of the sugars in the malt become caramelized and thus unfermentable, which is why caramel malt is usually used (like an adjunct) to add sweetness and body to the finished beer, instead of as a base malt.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="buckwheat-mash">Buckwheat mash&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In &amp;ldquo;caramel&amp;rdquo; malts made from common grains like barley and wheat, the starch is already gelatinized and saccharified in the core. Malted buckwheat gelatinizes at a temperature that is higher than that at which the amylase becomes denatured. To get any significant fermentables out of buckwheat, a decoction mash or exogenous enzymes may be necessary. Andrew Lavery has some &lt;a href="https://glutenfreehomebrewing.com/lavery_brewing_tutorial.php">good info&lt;/a> on mashing gluten-free grains.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>30 minutes at 95¬∞F&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 hour at ~113¬∞F&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 hour at ~130¬∞F (decocted 1/3 at the end; boiled for 5 minutes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 hours at ~150¬∞F (decocted 1/3 at the end; and boiled for 5 minutes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 hour at ~160¬∞F (decocted 1/3 at the end; boiled for 5 minutes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 hour at ~170¬∞F&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The buckwheat malt soaks up water like a sponge, so this mash turned out very thick. It smelled mildly sweet and smoky, reminiscent of toasted sesame seeds. Not at all what you&amp;rsquo;d expect with a typical &amp;ldquo;caramel&amp;rdquo; malt made from barley or wheat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After saccharification, the mash tasted sweet-ish and boldly buckwheaty.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="buckwheat-barm">Buckwheat barm&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A lot of people consider the flavor of buckwheat to be in the same general category as rye, but far more rustic, earthy, and flavorful than any of the routinely used grains. Part of that character derives from buckwheat&amp;rsquo;s caprylic acid content. Caprylic acid (octanoic acid) is a medium-chain fatty acid that is naturally found in palm oil, coconut oil, and milk. It&amp;rsquo;s a part of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) products, and believed to have potent antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. FYI, &lt;em>capr&lt;/em>- comes from Latin &lt;em>capra&lt;/em>, meaning &amp;ldquo;goat&amp;rdquo;; a lot of people say buckwheat adds a load of &amp;ldquo;goaty&amp;rdquo; flavor, which I disagree with.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>One great thing about some &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo;-tasting fatty acids is that they provide appealing aromas after &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> combines them with a molecule of ethanol to form an ester. Buckwheat has been &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228761224_Processing_of_a_Top_Fermented_Beer_Brewed_from_100_Buckwheat_Malt_with_Sensory_and_Analytical_Characterisation">researched&lt;/a> for its possible caprylic acid contribution to &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> fermentation, during which the Brett might convert these fatty acid precursors to create ethyl caprylate, an ester often described as sweet, waxy, floral, fruity, pineapple, and wine.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>KolnasƒÅta is traditionally used to &lt;a href="https://www.kulinaraismantojums.lv/en/biedri/home-producers/production-of-home-brewed-beer-kolnasata/">brew beers at home in Latgale&lt;/a> (aka. the land of blue lakes), a historical region in eastern Latvia. The brewing usually takes place in wooden tuns, and calls for locally-grown barley malt that&amp;rsquo;s dried in a smoke sauna.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This yeast is expected to produce &amp;ldquo;ample doses of pineapple esters along with medium attenuation and flocculation.&amp;rdquo; I thought this profile would pair well with the other yeasts I was going to add to the barm later on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Escarpment&amp;rsquo;s recommended temperature range for KolnasƒÅta is 68-86¬∞F, so I let the inoculated mash (aka. barm) ferment, loosely covered, at 80-84¬∞F for 12 hours. The barm began to show signs of fermentation and exude a subtle fruity aroma like peach and pineapple.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Next, I added 0.9g of London Tropics from Berkeley Yeast. This London ale yeast-derived thiolized strain produced a POG bomb in a &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">previous experiment&lt;/a>, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to tone down the thiol level this time to see how the final bread might turn out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s recommended temperature range for London Tropics is 64-72¬∞F. I let the barm ferment at 66-70¬∞F for 24 hours. By the end, the thick mash had nearly risen by 50%-70% and felt fluffy. It smelled much more fruity, pleasantly balanced between guava and pineapple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Stage 3: Brettanomyces&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I intended to add 2g of &lt;em>Brettanomyces bruxellensis&lt;/em>. Due to a squirting accident with the homebrew pouch, I ended up adding 6g of the liquid yeast. The 6% inoculation rate was not intentional, but it is what it is.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Total: 187.9g&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I let this barm sit in my fermentation fridge (set to ~45¬∞F) for 4 days. The barm puffed up like my Italian &lt;em>lievito madre&lt;/em>, and developed a more complex aroma that was very pleasing, but hard to put into words.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Flavor-wise, it was predominantly earthy buckwheat (reminding me of toasted black sesame seeds), with a charming malty character and mildly fruity undertone. I liked it, a lot. While biting into it, I pictured myself in a hammock swaying on a sun-soaked island in the Black Sea.&lt;/p>

Otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s probably an acquired taste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I guess quartering thiol levels in this bread worked out well. Once again, more isn&amp;rsquo;t (always) better. It&amp;rsquo;s all about understanding what you want to achieve and how your yeast will behave. Recipes are very overrated.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Given a lot more thiol precursors come from malts than hops, it probably makes more sense to play with different base malts and malt varieties than with new age hops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>German scientists have devised &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c06305">a solvent-free, automated method&lt;/a> for brewers to measure and track hop-derived thiols during the brewing process. How cool would it be, to be able to quantify the amount of thiol precursors in different malts, and find out which malt varieties pair the best with a particular thiolized yeast?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Most maltsters don&amp;rsquo;t list information about their grain varieties, only generic info like the malt type (pale, pilsner, crystal, etc). To find out the specific varietals of grains the malts are made from, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to ask the maltsters directly for COAs (certificates of analysis).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with enough grains (of different varieties) to know that the varietal can make a big difference in the end-product, e.g. a bread made from 100% &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/turkey-red/">Turkey Red&lt;/a> is noticeably different from one made from 100% &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/joaquin-oro/">Joaquin Oro&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/white-sonora/">Sonora Blanca&lt;/a>. In pale ales, modern barley varieties like Metcalfe and Copeland from Montana or western Canada may be more suited to the American style than the others, while heirloom varieties like Golden Promise or Maris Otter add a bit of nutty character to British variations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many brewers proudly describe their base malts &amp;ndash; the vast majority of the grist in most beers &amp;ndash; simply as &amp;ldquo;2-row.&amp;rdquo; That label merely indicates it&amp;rsquo;s not the &amp;ldquo;inferior&amp;rdquo;, higher-protein 6-row barley variety. But those are broad categories &amp;ndash; just like &lt;a href="https://newenglandapples.org/2020/10/16/russets-small-size-big-flavor/">russet&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.chelseagreen.com/2022/surprisingly-sweet-crab-apples/">crab&lt;/a>, and club are categories of apples (so much for the Johnny Appleseed fairy tale) &amp;ndash; and imply nothing about the actual barley variety, even less about how the grain is malted. Most brewers just take whatever malt variety is available, maybe occasionally thinking about 2-row vs. 6-row, winter vs. summer, maltster vs. maltster, and US-Canada vs. Europe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As with wheat, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that if a malt is generic enough to be characterized by just its category, it&amp;rsquo;s not going to give the end-product much flavor or character. But what really made me appreciate malt as a craft, in and of itself, was 2 things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Learning how to make traditional Baltic peasant rye bread from single-variety grain (rye) during 2020 COVID lockdown. In rural villages in Belarus and Latvia, for example, grandmas still make some of the world&amp;rsquo;s most flavorful (and underrated) breads today &amp;ndash; with only rye flour, water, salt, and natural yeast; they coax incredibly complex flavors out of the unassuming rye kernel through different stages of chemical reactions. That inspired me to malt my own rye for breadmaking: pale rye malt, Russian red fermented rye malt (&lt;em>solod&lt;/em>), chocolate rye malt, and even malt syrup, from different varieties of rye (Abruzzi, Gazelle, Hazlet, Ryman, &lt;em>Svedjerug&lt;/em>, Prima, etc). I was absolutely mesmerized by the different flavor profile and intensity each rye malt (and each rye variety) added to the final bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Studying European beer history. European beer styles evolved in tandem with local barley varieties and malt. Particularly in places like Bavaria, &lt;em>Helles&lt;/em> (pale lagers) &amp;ndash; despite being delicately hopped and regularly made with just a single malt &amp;ndash; taste different across breweries, because the malt, which is the whole ballgame, is different. Breweries have access to dozens of different malthouses, each making their pilsner malts slightly differently, from a range of different barley varieties. The same is true &amp;ndash; and even more pronounced &amp;ndash; in the UK, where ale brewers not only know which facility makes their malt, but also have passionate opinions about the barley variety. In cask ales, for example, the differences between different barley varieties and malts are magnified, creating distinct flavors.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>One of the factors that contributed to the development of the brewing industry as a whole was the spread of pale malts. In the Late Middle Ages, England had been struggling with wood shortages and switched to using the cheaper coal. A major problem with coal was that it produces sulfurous fumes during burning, and the flavors imparted to malt dried in coal-fueled kilns &amp;ndash; and subsequently the beer &amp;ndash; were &lt;a href="https://www.beeretseq.com/where-theres-smoke-theres-pale-ale/">not acceptable&lt;/a>. Hence, in &lt;em>ye olden times&lt;/em> malt had to be dried over wood, peat, or straw &amp;ndash; all of which infused malt with the smoky character of the heat source and gave it a brown color &amp;ndash; or the best Welsh anthracite, the supply of which was quite limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1603, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Plat">Sir Hugh Plat&lt;/a> suggested that coal might be charred in a manner analogous to the way charcoal is produced from wood. He heated some coal without burning it, which distilled the coal, removed its offensive sulfurous smell, and left a residue with a high carbon content and few impurities. This was coke, which proved to be a highly useful fuel for heating and industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The coke process remained unnoticed until 1642, when malt makers in Derbyshire began to employ coke for roasting malt. Coke demonstrated superior qualities over other fuels at the time: It generates a great deal of heat without the attendant soot and smoke, and it allows better thermal control. Coke-dried malt was considered an improvement in quality over wood-dried malt, and brought about an &amp;ldquo;alteration which all England admired.&amp;rdquo; Brewers were finally able to mass-produce a lighter roast of the malt that was not &amp;ldquo;smoked.&amp;rdquo; This malt was called &amp;ldquo;pale,&amp;rdquo; and it led to the creation of what by the end of the 17th century was called &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp;quot;&lt;strong>pale ale&lt;/strong>.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> Coke became the &lt;em>cr√®me de la cr√®me&lt;/em> of fuels in England. Coke-fired blast furnaces made the production of inexpensive cast iron possible, which was one of the factors that drove the Industrial Revolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The British Empire was in full sway, with merchants and traders traveling around the world. India was the &amp;ldquo;crown jewel&amp;rdquo; of the empire, hosting a large British military and civilian population with a thirst for beer. The tropical climate in India made local brewing of typical English pale ales impossible. Casks of porters and stouts shipped in from England fared poorly because of the long sea voyage and temperature fluctuations; bottled products produced mixed results as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1790, George Hogeson of the Bow Brewery in London developed a recipe for pale ale that included a huge increase in hops and a much higher alcohol content (both known to have preservative qualities). The export casks were primed with sugar and dry-hopped prior to shipping. The resulting beer arrived in India unspoiled, but much stronger and hoppier than the domestic version. This &amp;ldquo;India Pale Ale&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong>IPA&lt;/strong>) quickly became hugely popular and profitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pale malt has a huge advantage over darker malts: It contains more enzymes and more fermentable sugars, which allows for more efficient beer production; the taste of the finished beer is much cleaner, as yeasts are able to break down a higher percentage of the chemical compounds dissolved in wort. This fact was likely not explicitly known to brewers until the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrometer#Saccharometer">saccharometer&lt;/a> was invented in the late 18th century. Given that coke was too expensive for commercial brewing back then, pale ales remained mostly exclusive to the households of the wealthy gentry in northern England.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the US, light lager was the focus of domestic breweries until ~2000. The specific needs of breweries for producing this style of beer trumped the beer&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;character&amp;rdquo; development. 2-row malt is good enough; the barley and malt industries became streamlined to efficiently produce this neutral, light-flavored product for the purpose of brewing domestic light lagers. This specialization, however, created a structural problem for craft breweries looking for malt flavors &amp;ndash; worse, it led to a zymurgic myopia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, American breweries don&amp;rsquo;t have nearly the selection of malts that Germans have. Weyermann, a common source, makes a high-quality pilsner malt from 2-row spring barley. Brewers love its strong, distinctive character, which really makes a lager pop. The problem is every lager tastes like Weyermann¬Æ pilsner malt, which is why so many breweries in Bavaria use different malthouses to differentiate their beers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Craft brewing has gone through eras of hop enlightenment and yeast consciousness. Not too long ago, brewers were content with a handful of C-hops and some Chico yeast. Now hop breeders release dozens of new hops a year; yeast labs and yeast varieties are mushrooming. Brewers are constantly tinkering with ingredients to produce new flavors, and highly attuned to subtle differences.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I ask my maltsters to include the barley variety mix in their analysis data. Having a malt analysis without varietal data is like describing a dog without knowing the breed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dan Carey, New Glarus Brewing&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It seemed like a watershed moment when we first scratched the surface of &amp;ldquo;biotransformation&amp;rdquo; and, subsequently, the effect of ester-rich yeasts on IPAs. As this style has evolved by leaps and bounds, we have gained a better understanding of how hops interact with different processes &amp;ndash; and with yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How might different base malts affect beers?&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>America does have a number of &lt;a href="https://craftmalting.com/">craft malthouses&lt;/a>. Although many aren&amp;rsquo;t yet able to supply breweries with a reliable source of base malts for a year of regular-production beer, things might change with growing interest that will allow them to increase production and lower prices to compete with mass-produced malts. Some of these craft malts are not only interesting and flavorful, but also benefit the local economy and environment. A world with dozens of small, viable malthouses has the potential to transform beer tremendously, like hops and yeasts did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the single-origin base malts crafted by &lt;a href="https://www.gallatinvalleymalt.com/">Gallatin Valley Malt&lt;/a> (a farmer-owned craft malthouse in Manhattan, Montana) are quite distinct from the same types I&amp;rsquo;ve tried from several other malthouses (including &lt;a href="https://montanacraftmalt.com/">Montana Craft Malt&lt;/a>, which is located only ~1 hour away from Gallatin Valley Malt).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Heather Sargent, Head Maltstress at Gallatin Valley Malt, articulates the variability to me:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Malts will generally vary in flavor and analysis between malt houses for several reasons. Where the barley is grown and how it&amp;rsquo;s grown play a huge part in the quality that the Maltster has to work with. Whether or not the grain is blended is another factor. Dry farming vs. irrigated. The way in which the grain is malted. Therefore, brewers can make their determinations based on the outcomes and what they like.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That means, there are thousands of variations in just the &amp;ldquo;pale malt&amp;rdquo;! And the malt that goes into the recipe matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Breweries' chalkboards and printed menus often boast hop varieties, hoping (often correctly) that words like Citra, Enigma, or Lemondrop will entice customers to order a pint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s rare, literally unheard of, for a brewery to advertise the malt bill on a menu (although it does show up from time to time on labels). The most overlooked ingredient can mean the difference between an enjoyable pint and a drain pour, and even help a brewery stand out and differentiate itself from the pack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In what appears to be a fairly mature industry, craft malts have a chance to inject a new wave of innovation into our glasses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The varieties of the grains that go into the malt are just as important as the hops that go into the wort. And not only the variety, but also the growing region (terroir) affects the malt&amp;rsquo;s flavor, haze, and foam stability.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="saccharified-mash">Saccharified mash&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I limited thiol precursor-loaded, diastatic barley malt to 30% of total grains in the mash; the rest was all adjuncts, as far as diastatic powers and thiol precursors are concerned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The light-golden &lt;a href="https://www.gallatinvalleymalt.com/gallatin-pale">pale malt&lt;/a> by Gallatin Valley Malt, made from Genie barley (grown, harvested, and malted right on GVM&amp;rsquo;s own farm in Montana&amp;rsquo;s breadbasket, the fertile &lt;a href="https://bozemanmagazine.com/articles/2018/09/04/102964-gallatin-agricultural-history">Gallatin Valley&lt;/a>, in a true field-to-kiln fashion), has an endearing aroma of sweet biscuits out of the box. When freshly ground, the malt tastes like Honey Nut Cheerios with a yummy sunflower seed butter drizzle &amp;ndash; none of the grass/straw/hay notes I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed in pale malts from some other malthouses.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I milled the grains into a flour, and mixed everything with water. I intentionally kept the mash thick, because I wanted to create an Italian &lt;em>lievito madre&lt;/em>-style stiff barm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mash then went through&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="barm">Barm&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>People seem to love to hate on the &amp;ldquo;Chico&amp;rdquo; strain. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing the main reason is that it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; strain that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get you &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; flavors like some other yeasts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, Jeremy Myers, head of production for Bachs Biermanufaktur in Saarland, Germany, &lt;a href="https://beerandbrewing.com/cold-healthy-and-crowded-lager-fermentation-simplified/">suggests&lt;/a> using White Labs WLP001 for lagers. He says &amp;ldquo;fermenting cold with that yeast leaves behind a beer with just the kind of clean, crisp flavor we want in a lager.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IMO, &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; strains like WLP001 are clean, versatile, low-ester, and low-phenol. They can be super useful and valuable in the right context. For example, they are &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/wlp001/">terrific for breads&lt;/a> that are intended to highlight a grain&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>terroir&lt;/em>. If you ferment a few doughs with WLP001, keeping everything the same except the flours (use different varieties of wheat, e.g. Joaquin Oro vs. Sonora Blanca vs. Turkey Red), I bet you&amp;rsquo;d taste different flavors and &amp;ldquo;grain-forwardness&amp;rdquo; in each baked product. At least I did. In the &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-1-2/">whole wheat bread&lt;/a> I made with WLP001, the yeast elevated the character of Turkey Red to such a degree that I never thought it was possible (with sourdough or bread yeast), and produced a stunningly pure, robust wheat flavor without the slightest hint of acidity &amp;ndash; it was like eating a box of Triscuit Original or drinking an American wheat beer. Pure, authentic, natural wheatopia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like how the Chico strain drove IPA 2.0 due to its &amp;ldquo;cleanness&amp;rdquo; that emphasizes malt and allows hops to shine through, I think it has the potential to do the same thing for Pizza/Bread 3.0 (especially when coupled with the &amp;ldquo;local grain&amp;rdquo; movement). Clean strains highlight the humble grain and let the grain flavor shine through, much more so than sourdough or bread yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this case, I scooped out 140g of the cooled mash (260g remaining), and added a 50/50 blend of &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/london-tropics/">London Tropics&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/wlp001/">WLP001 California ale yeast&lt;/a>. I intended to temper the thiol levels and let other characteristics stand out, to create a multi-layered, balanced bouquet of tropical aromas/flavors. (ICYMI, London Tropics proved to be an incredibly powerful &amp;ldquo;weapon of mass thiolization&amp;rdquo; in my &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">last experiment&lt;/a>.)&lt;/p>

&lt;td>0.7g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Total: 141.4g&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I added both yeasts at the same time, since they have similar optimal temperature range. I let the barm ferment, loosely covered, at 68-72¬∞F for ~18 hours. The barm doubled in volume by the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">last time&lt;/a>, POG-type tropical aromas started to manifest ~3 hours in, but never got as pungent, which was expected, since the amount of precursors in the mash was drastically reduced and the inoculation rate of thiolized yeast was halved.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This time, I decided to make a batch of &lt;em>bomboloni&lt;/em> (yeasted Italian donuts), instead of a loaf of bread. And I intentionally made these &lt;em>bomboloni&lt;/em> much more austere than &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/california-dreamin-5/">the Sonora Blanca version&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>No sugar in the dough, because I wanted the sweetness to come from the coating on the outside, which would make the layers complement each other as you bite through them. Heterogeneity and contrast!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Mix everything together into a stiff dough. (The dough smelt gently sweet and fruity, like a floral forest after rain.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Bulk ferment at ~72¬∞F for 6 hours. Fold once every 30 mins, 4 times in total.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Retard in the fermentation fridge (~45¬∞F) for 12 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Divide into 12 pieces (~62g each), and shape into taut balls.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Proof at ~72¬∞F for ~6 hours until doubled in size.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Heat a pot of coconut oil to 350¬∞F; fry for 5-7 minutes on each side until brown and crispy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Remove from oil and let dry on a wire rack lined with paper towels.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once cool (but still warm), coat in homemade powdered sugar enhanced with a dash of cinnamon.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>These donuts had a super fluffy, airy texture, almost completely concealing the fact they were made from unsifted whole grains. They also had a substantial mouthfeel &amp;ndash; quite contrary to the emptiness I always experience when eating donuts from national donut chains, which tend to be so overloaded with sugar that they melt in your mouth like cotton candy (in a bad way).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tropical aroma was hard to distinguish underneath the cinnamon sugar coating, but a ripe fruit flavor was noticeable in the crumb, alongside an unyielding wheat flavor. It mildly reminded me of Kellogg&amp;rsquo;s Tropical Froot Loops cereal. Definitely not POG bombs this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I think these thiol-complimentary &lt;em>bomboloni&lt;/em> turned out much more balanced and delectable than my &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">last thiol-dominant bake&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; once again, proving &amp;ldquo;more isn&amp;rsquo;t always better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, I don&amp;rsquo;t think the flavor was quite right &amp;ndash; it didn&amp;rsquo;t have the multi-layered bouquet of aromas/flavors I was expecting. Something was still amiss.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>¬†&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ICYMI, there has been a huge thiols-at-all-cost craze going on in the brewing world. Heavily hopped IPAs with novel tropical fruit aromas and flavors have been a massive growth category. Triple New England IPA has consistently topped Untappd&amp;rsquo;s list of highest-average rated beer styles, and 1/3 of Untappd&amp;rsquo;s 120 million check-ins in 2022 were some kind of IPA. (Which makes one wonder about Heineken&amp;rsquo;s new American debut, Heineken¬Æ Silver, brewed specifically to meet &lt;em>Americans' distaste for bitter beers&lt;/em>.)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In 2022, the top three beer styles for the highest number of overall Untappd check-ins were: American IPA, New England IPA and Imperial IPA (the style distinction between an American and a New England IPA is hard to define as almost all of the world‚Äôs top 50 highest rated American IPAs are hazy in appearance). &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The IPAs of 2013 were so bright you could read that year‚Äôs best-of list through any of the beers. Sparkling and golden-amber in colour, they were simply American IPAs and didn‚Äôt need a West Coast prefix to make drinkers realise it‚Äôs not a hazy New England beer ‚Äì the whole prospect of a cloudy yellow IPA was still a curiosity. Viewed from 2023, where almost all IPAs (and Pale Ales) are now at least a bit hazy, and many are totally opaque with a mouthfeel often described with adjectives like smooth, thick and juicy, those original West Coasters feel like a throwback. That clean clarity and crispness of flavour has gone sweet and squidgy, and it‚Äôs not just the IPAs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Commercial breweries and home-brewers all over the world are injecting new products (e.g. Thiolized¬Æ yeasts and Phantasm¬Æ thiol powder), switching to fancy hops (e.g. Vic Secret‚Ñ¢, Amarillo¬Æ, Mandarina Bavaria, Nelson Sauvin‚Ñ¢, and Motueka‚Ñ¢) and hop products (e.g. Cryo Hops¬Æ, Incognito¬Æ, Salvo‚Ñ¢, and SubZero Hop Kief‚Ñ¢), and trying new techniques (e.g. mash-hopping) to make &amp;ldquo;thiol bombs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The results have been mixed. There are some success stories underneath the hype, but a number of brewers say it&amp;rsquo;s just a cranked-up odd flavor (mostly aroma) that may not even compliment the finished beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Evidently, tinkering with thiols takes a lot of &amp;ldquo;trial and error.&amp;rdquo; The wine industry has been researching and creating thiol-optimized strains since ~2004, nearly 20 years before the beer industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to go down the thiol rabbit and see what it was all about.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="thiology">Thiology&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Over the last several decades, there have been endless studies on the hop plant and the enormous impact hops have had on craft brewing, particularly in America. New hop varieties have been &lt;a href="https://daily.sevenfifty.com/beer-hops-are-going-high-tech/">R&amp;amp;D&amp;rsquo;ed&lt;/a>, specifically focusing on the creation of compounds that humans perceive to impart bold tropical fruit aromas and flavors.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="embed music-spotify">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>American hop varieties are characteristically fruity; they add aromas of citrus, pine, tropical fruit, black currant, sweat, and onion/garlic to beer, thanks to the aromatic compounds that originate in the hops' essential oil, which is comprised predominantly of mono- and sesqui-terpenes (volatile organic compounds that play crucial roles in human perception of table grape and wine flavors), some terpene alcohols, and a tiny bit of sulfur-containing &lt;strong>thiols&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Researchers have found that these biotransformative thiols are the main contributors to the highly sought-after tropical aromas, and thus may be giving certain hop varieties an edge over others. (Biotransformation just means the development of new aromas and flavors when yeast interacts with this &lt;em>sm√∂rg√•sbord&lt;/em> of compounds.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thiols (also called mercaptans, with the general formula R-SH), are sulfur analogs of alcohols.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three volatile thiol molecules responsible for tropical aromas in beer have been in the spotlight across the winemaking and brewing communities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>3-mercaptohexanol (&lt;strong>3MH&lt;/strong>), which creates citrus aromas like grapefruit and gooseberry;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3-mercaptohexyl acetate (&lt;strong>3MHA&lt;/strong>), which can come across as guava or passion fruit; and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4-mercapto-4-methylpentan-2-one (&lt;strong>4MMP&lt;/strong>), which the nose recognizes as black current or wood aromas.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Instead of smelling sulfury like rotten eggs, these free, volatile thiols have tropical and fruity aromas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see, the first 2 molecules &amp;ndash; 3MH and its acetate ester, 3MHA &amp;ndash; are almost solely responsible for imparting strong tropical fruit aromas.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-5-1/what-are-thiols.png"
alt="An overview of thiols"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>An overview of thiols: structure, aroma profile, and threshold. The small concentrations make a ton of difference in human perceived aromas and flavors.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The thiol content in hops depends strongly on the variety, and can be influenced by harvest maturity, terroir, and other seasonal variables. Several of the most popular hops of the last decade, e.g. Cascade, Citra¬Æ, Simcoe¬Æ, Nelson Sauvin‚Ñ¢, and Mosaic¬Æ, are found to contain&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>free thiols&lt;/strong>, which are aroma-active, volatile compounds such as 3MH, 3MHA and 4MMP that are soluble in beer; as well as&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>thiol precursors&lt;/strong>, which are &amp;ldquo;bound&amp;rdquo;, non-aroma-active, non-volatile compounds that can be liberated &amp;ndash; with the help of a specific enzyme &amp;ndash; from the amino acids they are bound to, and thus become free and aromatic.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The presence of these thiol compounds, alongside the complex array of terpenes and other essential oils, seem to give these hop varieties an edge when creating fruit-forward beers such as American IPAs. Some of these hops are running out in places, probably due to this thiol craze (and supply chain disruptions).&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="free thiols in hops"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Published data on free thiols in hops&lt;/p>&lt;p>Source: &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/files/CBC-Development-of-Thiols-and-Thiol-Precursors-in-Different-Hop-Varieties.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Christina Sch√∂nberger and Laurent Dagan, Craft Brewers Conference 2020&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Most common thiol precursors, in their conjugated (glutathionylated or cysteinylated, often written as &lt;strong>Glut-3MH&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>Cys-3MH&lt;/strong>) and therefore non-active forms, have been identified in multiple other plant raw materials as well, such as grapes (and musts), tannin, fruits, and malts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many plants naturally produce an odorless molecule (Glut-3MH) as a byproduct of glutathione metabolism. Some of this Glut-3MH is converted into a second, non-volatile molecule, Cys-3MH, through the activity of naturally occurring plant enzymes; then, another plant enzyme converts some of this Cys-3MH into the aroma-active thiol, 3MH.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-5-1/F2_pathway-01.png"
alt="Biosynthesis of 3MH in plants"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Biosynthesis of 3MH in plants (red arrows = enzymatic reactions)&lt;/p>&lt;p>Source: &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/science-lesson/enhance-thiol-biotransformation-with-tropics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Berkeley Yeast&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Pure natural magic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The efficiency of each step in this biosynthetic pathway varies dramatically across different plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In tropical fruits like guava and passion fruit, for example, the conversion of Glut-3MH &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Cys-3MH &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; 3MH is very efficient, and these plants contain a high concentration of 3MH as a result. That&amp;rsquo;s why tropical fruits smell like tropical fruits &amp;ndash; they contain significant sources of volatile thiol compounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In barley malts and hops, however, the efficiency of these two reactions is obviously low (that&amp;rsquo;s why these two naturally don&amp;rsquo;t smell like tropical fruits). The enzymes that catalyze each conversion are inefficient, producing few 3MH molecules. Even in hops that are famous for tropical fruit characters, researchers have found that &amp;lt;=1% of the Glut-3MH is actually converted to 3MH.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consequently, barley malts and hops contain a low concentration of free thiols like 3MH, but high concentrations of thiol precursors like Glut-3MH and Cys-3MH.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>That means, the abundance of thiol precursors found in hops and malts have the potential to be converted into volatile thiols during fermentation &amp;ndash; just think about how exciting it would be to figure out how to unlock it all! This, indeed, has recently become a subject of great interest &amp;ndash; or even obsession &amp;ndash; for brewers. The reason is simple: While these thiol precursor molecules are flavorless, it only takes 1-2 enzymatic reactions to biotransform them into aroma-active 3MH and unleash a tropical fruit nirvana.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of these yeast-encoded enzymes capable of converting flavorless precursor molecules into volatile thiols during &amp;ldquo;biotransformation&amp;rdquo; is &lt;strong>cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyase&lt;/strong> (&lt;strong>CSL&lt;/strong>), from the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. This enzyme can break the carbon-sulfur bond present in these odorless cysteinylated thiol precursors, releasing the highly aroma-active unconjugated form (polyfunctional/free thiols).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A number of companies have created various new products that focus on enhancing thiol biotransformation. There are currently two main approaches, and they often go hand in hand:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>increase the load of thiols in the mash, especially in the bound form (since thiol precursors are abundant in nature and non-volatile);&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>manipulate the enzymes to turbocharge the thiol biosynthesis process.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I will look at some of the most popular products in each category.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thiol-precursor-enhancers">Thiol precursor enhancers&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Outside of thiol precursor-laden hops like Calypso‚Ñ¢, Cascade, Mittelfr√ºh, and ≈Ωatec (Saaz), one (overhyped) product that claims to enhance or elevate thiol precursors is Phantasm¬Æ, a powder made from New Zealand Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc grapes, which are said to be incredibly rich in both free thiols and Cys-3MH &amp;ndash; allegedly a much higher concentration of thiols than hops and malts.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-5-1/Phantasm-powder.jpg"
alt="Phantasm thiol powder"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Phantasm thiol powder, frequently touted as &amp;lsquo;the biggest modern-day game-changer for hop aroma.&amp;rsquo; Like new iPhones, this product has a super long waiting list and is hard to get.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Phantasm came from the owner of Garage Project, a brewery based in the Aro Valley of Wellington, New Zealand, near the Marlborough region, famous for producing exceptionally high-quality Sauvignon Blancs known for their intense tropical fruit aromas. New Zealand has been ground zero for thiol research as it pertains to the wine industry, with scientists working to better understand how to unlock thiols in Marlborough&amp;rsquo;s expressive Sauvignon Blanc grapes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out that after winemakers use those thiol-laden grape skins, they throw them away.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Maybe one winemaker&amp;rsquo;s trash is another beermaker&amp;rsquo;s treasure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Jos Ruffell, founder of Phantasm and owner of Garage Project&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Ruffell found a way to dehydrate and powderize those leftover Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc grape skins, making a thiol-rich product that brewers could use to enhance the aromas of their beers. A pretty clever business idea.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Ruffell brought Phantasm to market in late 2020, marketing it primarily as an aroma-enhancer in hazy IPAs. Stories of early successes by popular brewing companies, including Ruffell&amp;rsquo;s own Garage Project, went viral on the internet, and created instant, fervent demand that far exceeded supply.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phantasm is an experimental product in extremely short supply out of New Zealand, derived from Sauvignon Blanc grape skins. We&amp;#39;re very honored to be one of the first few breweries in the world, and first in Canada with access to play with this super magical powder.&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Kilter Brewing (@kilterbrewing) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kilterbrewing/status/1371661768838107144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2021&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>Unsurprisingly, Phantasm (both the name of that company and its flagship product) has taken the brewing world by storm. (I wonder how much of a role the scarce availability and perceived exclusivity have played in Phantasm&amp;rsquo;s stratospheric popularity.) Outside of the core four (hops, malt, yeast, and water), Phantasm¬Æ is the &amp;ldquo;hottest&amp;rdquo; brewing ingredient on the market today.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Essentially, brewing with Phantasm is like an MSG addition for aroma.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In December 2022, Phantasm (the company) held the inaugural Phantasm Cup, a new (annual) competition to find the best thiol-forward beer in North America, sponsored by Half Acre Brewing and Omega Yeast, in Chicago. The grand prize &amp;ndash; an all-expenses-paid trip to New Zealand during hop harvest &amp;ndash; went to Wise Man Brewing (Winston-Salem, North Carolina), which won for a New Zealand-hopped NEIPA incorporating the theme ingredient.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Other standout Phantasm-enriched beers include a trio of Phuture beers, brewed via 3-way collaboration among three San Diego breweries, each featuring Phantasm¬Æ but a different beer style and hop combination:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Pure Project Brewing: Phuture I (New England / Hazy IPA; 6.5% ABV)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Harland Brewing: Phuture II (New England / Hazy Double IPA; 8.0% ABV)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>North Park Beer Co.: Phuture III (New England / Hazy Triple IPA; 10% ABV)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Another California-based collaborative brew from Alvarado Street Brewery and Green Cheek Beer Co., a double-dry-hopped Imperial Hazy IPA with Phantasm¬Æ, Nelson Sauvin‚Ñ¢, Riwaka‚Ñ¢, and Citra¬Æ, named Thiology 101, also impressed. Notice the pattern?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, Ruffell continues to capitalize on the worldwide &amp;ldquo;thiol craze&amp;rdquo;, by working on thiol-packed blends of Phantasm¬Æ and hops. He&amp;rsquo;s collaborating with Yakima Chief Hops to develop an experimental blend of Phantasm¬Æ combined with Citra¬Æ, Mosaic¬Æ and Simcoe¬Æ Cryo hops, and teaming up with Freestyle Hops to create a &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.freestylehops.com/hop-varieties/mega-motueka/">Mega Motueka&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; blend of Phantasm¬Æ and Motueka‚Ñ¢ hops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Expansion of Phantasm&amp;rsquo;s operation is also on the table. In fact, a liquid version of Phantasm¬Æ is in the pipeline, which is shown during trials to be up to 40x as concentrated as the powder, and successful in contributing deepened aromas to finished beers.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Some brewers use Phantasm¬Æ powder in tandem with hop varieties that already produce a solid base of thiol precursors, such as Citra¬Æ and Nelson Sauvin‚Ñ¢, and add a thiolized yeast strain to coax the fullest range of tropical aromatics out of the brew.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We just threw a bunch of shit in the beer and called it good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.craftbrewingbusiness.com/news/weldwerks-explains-its-use-of-a-thiol-named-phantasm-and-other-beers-to-know-this-week/">Craft Brewing Business&lt;/a> recently asked Skip Schwartz, Innovation and Wood Cellar Lead at WeldWerks Brewing Co., about what it was like brewing with Phantasm:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Did Phantasm save costs by perhaps requiring less hops than usual to attain an even bigger flavor?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this is our first time using this product, there is still a lot for us to learn and how best to use it. We are planning on trying at least a few more beers using Phantasm before we fully make any decisions. The bigger thing is that it does not change the flavor, just the aroma. Since Phantasm is a thiol, it works more on your orthonasal than it does on your taste buds, but you do notice more defined hop characteristics on your retronasal as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Like I said earlier, tinkering with thiols is a lot of &amp;ldquo;trial and error.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thiolized-yeasts">Thiolized yeasts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Having a glut of thiol precursors alone isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. The true trick is unlocking them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter &amp;ldquo;thiolized&amp;rdquo; yeasts, which are capable of producing CSL during fermentation to free thiols from their precursors, allowing them to have a sensory impact on the end-product.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0740002011000141">IRC7&lt;/a> is the key gene at the center of current research, because it encodes a CSL enzyme. A &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsyr/article/15/5/fov034/2467698">research paper&lt;/a> found that &amp;ldquo;a full-length copy of IRC7 is absolutely required for the cleavage of both precursors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many brewing yeast strains naturally contain the IRC7 gene. However, most of the naturally occurring CSLs in brewing yeasts aren&amp;rsquo;t as active as CSLs from other species, e.g. the CSL of &lt;em>S. hominis&lt;/em>, a natural bacterium commonly found on human skin, is far more active and more specific in generating tropical aromas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ideal yeast strains for thiol biotransformation are those that are capable of &lt;em>both&lt;/em> fermentation and high CSL activity. Unfortunately, this combination is quite rare in the yeast world. Most traditional brewing yeasts have mutations in the IRC7 gene that deactivate the enzyme. Of those that do have a functional IRC7 gene, they are capable of only releasing 3MH from the Cys-3MH precursor, while leaving all of the Glut-3MH untapped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Current methods used to develop new yeasts for efficiently catalyzing thiol biotransformation include&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>interspecifically crossing strains with naturally high IRC7 activity to achieve &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00217-022-04132-6">hybrid vigor&lt;/a>&amp;quot;; and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>genetically modifying existing yeast strains to galvanize higher CSL activity.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>FWIW, lager yeast (&lt;em>Saccharomyces pastorianus&lt;/em>) is a natural hybrid between &lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em> and the newly discovered &lt;em>Saccharomyces eubayanus&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an exciting time for yeast lovers between bio-engineered yeasts and heirloom kveiks.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>A mention of GMO inevitably evokes the popular stigma of Monsanto Roundup Ready¬Æ. Indeed, GMO has become a politically charged and highly polarizing topic; GMO foods are widely considered bad and dangerous, so much so that the EU has basically banned GMO crops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like artificial intelligence (AI), genetic modification is a tool, which can be utilized to transform our society, for better or worse. A blanket rejection of all GM products seems silly. Learning more about the history and place of genetic engineering in our society helps to fully understand and perhaps form an informed opinion on this technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em> probably contains ~6,000 genes, and genetically modifying them to produce specific chemicals and pharmaceuticals has &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24677744/">already been done&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In GMO yeasts, researchers essentially delete or add a targeted gene for a specific purpose, e.g. release certain esters, remove certain phenols, or enhance biotransformation potential. Also, a GMO yeast strain doesn&amp;rsquo;t require potentially dangerous pesticides and herbicides, like GMO seeds might. This distinction seems worth pointing out and keeping in mind.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>To catalyze efficient conversion of bound thiols to free thiols, the enzymatic activity of CSL needs to be turbocharged during fermentation. So far, there are 2 ways to do that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Activate or turn up the IRC7 gene within the yeast to (over)express CSL.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add exogenous hyperactive CSL.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Both can boost CSL enzyme activity during fermentation to elevated levels, to maximize the thiol biotransformation potential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A handful of thiol-unlocking strains have shown up on the market, specifically developed to enhance the yeast&amp;rsquo;s ability to biotransform compounds found in malt and hops to unleash thiols. The process of making each strain is different, even though the final product is advertised as being comparable, if not the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>White Labs&lt;/strong>, which caught the rising yeast wave and has sold some iconic products for nearly three decades around the world, is a latecomer. It only recently released its first thiol-unlocking product, &lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=267&amp;amp;type=YEAST">WLP077 Tropicale&lt;/a>, which is &lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/news-update-detail?id=74">a non-GMO blend of previously available strains&lt;/a> that are specifically selected for high IRC7 enzyme activity. (I could be wrong, but I doubt this blend will live up to the thiol-releasing potential of the new GMO strains from other labs. This seems like White Labs' way of catching up to the other companies while keeping the non-GMO tag.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Escarpment Labs&lt;/strong> has bred &lt;a href="https://escarpmentlabs.com/products/thiol-libre">Thiol Libre&lt;/a> from strains naturally high in IRC7 activity. (I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that the yeast appears to have lost quite a bit of its English ale character during the hybridization, while also not overexpressing the IRC7 gene that produces the required CSL enzyme to unlock thiols.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Omega Yeast&lt;/strong> has taken the GMO route and used CRISPR-Cas9 to cisgenically insert activated IRC7 gene (OYL-402 Cosmic Punch‚Ñ¢), or transgenically add skin bacteria-derived CSL gene (e.g. Helio Gazer‚Ñ¢, Star Party‚Ñ¢, and Lunar Crush‚Ñ¢), to produce Thiolized¬Æ versions of its popular yeast strains.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Berkeley Yeast&lt;/strong>, a startup founded by UC Berkeley scientists and funded by NSF, NIH, and USDA, as well as venture capital, has taken the transgenic GMO approach to bio-engineer the &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/available-yeast-strains/">Tropics‚Ñ¢ series&lt;/a>, which likely produce the strongest thiol characters of the bunch, because they sourced the &lt;em>TnaA&lt;/em> gene (encoding a tryptophanase with strong CSL activity &amp;ndash; probably the most active CSL known to the natural world so far) from &lt;em>Citrobacter freundii&lt;/em>, a commensal bacterium found in water, soil, food, and the intestines of humans and animals. (&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/yea.1493">Research&lt;/a> has demonstrated that expression in yeast of a bacterial enzyme with CSL activity results in very high levels of thiol production.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It seems yeast companies are drawing a line in the sand and deciding if they&amp;rsquo;re going to be GM or non-GM. The latter opens up the EU market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is yeast going to be the new hops? I think so.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="berkeley-yeast">Berkeley Yeast&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since I always root for entrepreneurial endeavors, I&amp;rsquo;d like to devote some ink to &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com">Berkeley Yeast&lt;/a>. The 6-year-old startup (based in Oakland, California) has risen out of the ashes of GigaYeast, which ended operations in July 2021. (Berkeley Yeast offers a &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/strains/vermont-tropics/">thiolized version&lt;/a> of GigaYeast Vermont IPA.)&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s first prototype was a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03293-x#auth-Rachel_A_-Li">bio-engineered brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast that makes terpenes&lt;/a> (linalool, geraniol, and citronellol), which produce hop-like citrus and floral flavors &amp;ndash; and make the &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/strains/chico-superbloom/">yeast&lt;/a> a potential drop-in replacement for hops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hops are a key ingredient in beer, and they grow best in just a few places on earth. Most of the US hop crop is grown in Yakima Valley in the state of Washington, which benefits from the Cascade mountains' watershed and sunny, fairly dry climate. Hop production is resource-intensive and increasingly unsustainable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disrupting the hop industry inevitably invites pushback. After all, using hops is part of the tradition of brewing and nobody wants to phase out hops entirely. Complementing hops, on the other hand, and allowing brewers to obtain similar tropical aromas without using those highly-demanded thiol-loaded hops, would be a smarter move.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s precisely how Berkeley Yeast evolved &amp;ndash; from hop-disruptive to hop-complimentary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s main thing, though, seems to be engineering &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/science-lesson/diacetyl-free-strains-prevent-diacetyl-formation/">diacetyl-free strains&lt;/a> that keep diacetyl (a buttery-tasting compound that&amp;rsquo;s undesirable in many types of beer) low during fermentation and after packaging, by inserting a gene that encodes the alpha acetolactate decarboxylase (ALDC) enzyme into the yeast genome. An ordinary yeast naturally converts fermentable sugars into Œ±-acetolactate (precursor to diacetyl) during fermentation. The ALDC enzyme consumes Œ±-acetolactate as it&amp;rsquo;s produced, and converts it into acetoin (the end product of the pathway), thus bypassing diacetyl formation. This ensures beer will stay fresh and clean after it leaves the brewery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They also have a STA1- Sacch Trois, dubbed Alexandre Trois, that &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/science-lesson/diastaticus-and-sta1/">has the STA1 gene deleted&lt;/a>, solving a big headache for breweries. (Middle finger to &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->White Labs &lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=182&amp;amp;type=YEAST&amp;amp;style_type=5">WLP644&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->?)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CRISPR-Cas9 is one way to edit genomes. The technology took a big step forward in the US in 2016 when the Department of Agriculture decided it &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.19754">would not regulate a CRISPR-edited mushroom&lt;/a>, which was engineered to resist browning by targeting a family of genes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Berkeley Yeast started GM trials with CRISPR, but now utilizes a different set of (open source) molecular scissors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to Omega&amp;rsquo;s top-selling Thiolized¬Æ series, Berkeley Yeast developed the Tropics‚Ñ¢ in a different way, but the purpose is the same: to produce more of the hyperactive enzyme that unlocks thiols.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Based on what I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered so far from research papers, podcasts, and various corners of the internet, my high-level understanding of how Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s Tropics‚Ñ¢ strains work is &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s two-fold:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Precursors &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; 3MH: a CSL-encoding gene (&lt;em>TnaA&lt;/em>) is transgenically sourced from a commensal bacterium, &lt;em>Citrobacter freundii&lt;/em>, and inserted into a parent London ale yeast strain to turbocharge the CSL enzyme, which breaks the carbon-sulfur bond in these odorless cysteinylated thiol precursors, releasing non-active thiols into the free, volatile, aromatic form (3MH).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>3MH &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; 3MHA: esters in &lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em> are produced by the alcohol acyltransferase (AAT), another yeast-encoded enzyme. One or more of the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->native AATs&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> expressed in the Tropics‚Ñ¢ strains is capable of acetylating 3MH to its acetate ester, 3MHA.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Because human sensory threshold for 3MHA (aromas of guava and passionfruit) is &lt;em>waaaay&lt;/em> lower than for 3MH (citrus aromas like grapefruit and gooseberry), a single molecule of 3MHA is perceived to be as potent as at least a dozen molecules of 3MH. It&amp;rsquo;s the synergy of these two molecules that creates a tropical fruit nirvana. Voila!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The best way to delve into thiols is to actually play with it, through hands-on &amp;ldquo;trial and error.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>TL;DR&lt;/code>: I made a simple wholegrain bread, with 38.5% barley malt flour and 61.5% whole wheat flour. I cooked up a big batch of the mash and split it into two equally. One was inoculated with Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/strains/london-tropics/">&lt;strong>London Tropics&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, the other with &lt;strong>London Tropics &lt;em>and&lt;/em> &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/boost/thiol/">Thiol Boost&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. Otherwise, these were exactly the same. (Equivalent of split-batch brewing; one recipe, two beers.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Spoiler&lt;/code>: The breads turned out COMPLETELY different. A tiny drop of Thiol Boost made a ton of difference. One had a crisp, assertive maltiness with a fruity undertone, the other had crazy fruit punch energy like a POG (passion fruit, orange, and guava) bomb.&lt;/p>

All the other undesirable plant molecules, such as 4MMP which may come across as diesely and dank, are stripped away.&lt;/p>

The flavor transports me back to childhood days of eating popsicles on a hot summer day. 1 tiny drop (0.5mL) goes a loooong way.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This is very much like brewing a beer, &lt;em>sans&lt;/em> hops. Instead, it relies on the gluten in wheat flour for structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aroma and flavor produced by London Tropics were very, very noticeable throughout the process and in the baked bread; that one drop of Thiol Boost made a ton of difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The devil, as always, is in the details.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="1-all-barley-malt-mash">1. All-barley malt mash&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Since thiol biotransformation begins with the precursor molecules (Glut-3MH and Cys-3MH), the amount of 3MH and 3MHA produced by thiolized yeast depends on the concentrations of these precursors in the grains used for baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As mentioned earlier, thiol precursors are not just in hops, but also &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/files/143_Dagan.pdf">largely abound in malts&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Researchers' key findings:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Glut-3MH was the most abundant precursor across malts considered.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Roasting appears to considerably reduce the amount of precursors, since no precursors were found in the most roasted malt sample. In other words, un-kilned or lightly kilned malts are shown to contain more precursors than kilned ones.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Malts made from barley are all higher in thiol precursors than non-barley varieties. Barley malts exhibited the highest concentrations of Glut-3MH and Cys-3MH with levels ranging from 40-700 mg/kg and from 1-7 mg/kg, respectively, much higher than malted rice, sorghum or wheat.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>I used a 5-step infusion mash to maximize the potential of endogenous enzymes. I did the whole thing on a kitchen stove top so I could easily apply direct heat when needed. It took 8 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Finely grind all the malts into flour. Mix with water. Start at 95¬∞F. Hold at 95-110¬∞F for 30 minutes (acid rest).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Gradually raise the temperature to ~130¬∞F. Hold at 128-133¬∞F for 30 minutes (protein rest; since most of the malts used here are well-modified and already contain higher levels of amino acids, the mash benefits from a protein rest closer to 133¬∞F than 122¬∞F, IMO).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Gradually raise the temperature to ~145¬∞F. Hold at 140-149¬∞F for 4 hours (beta-amylase conversion).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Gradually raise the temperature to ~158¬∞F. Hold at 155-162¬∞F for 2 hours (alpha-amylase conversion).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Gradually raise the temperature to ~168¬∞F. Hold at 168-170¬∞F for 1 hour (dextrin conversion).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>After 8 hours, the mash took on a darker brown color, and tasted incredibly malty and sweet, like a condensed wort. No fruity aroma or flavor whatsoever, as far as I could tell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Total: 580g (to be divided into 2 equal portions)&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="2-thiolized-barms">2. Thiolized barms&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I wanted to make 2 loaves of bread, one with London Tropics and Thiol Boost and the other with only London Tropics, to see how much of a sensory difference the booster would make.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I let the mash cool off to room temperature, and divided it into 2 equal portions, placed in 2 separate containers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s recommended dosage for Thiol Boost is 200-400 mL/BBL of wort, which is 0.17%-0.34% of wort volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I added the liquid yeast to both mashes at the same time, and mixed it in thoroughly. One hour later, I added a drop of Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s liquid Thiol Boost to barm #2.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I loosely covered both, and let them ferment at ambient temperatures (65-68¬∞F) until the yeast told me it had done its job. And that ended up taking ~50 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="-observation-log-">üìù Observation log üìù&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>After ~4 hours&lt;/strong>, tropical aromas started to manifest. Both barms smelled pungently fruity, with subtle differences.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Barm #1 (control) smelled like a pile of overripe guavas, bananas, and pineapples, with slight citrusy notes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Barm #2 (thiol boost+) smelled about the same, but with more sweetness to it that reminded me of persimmons.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The taste of both matched the aroma, too. Sweet and fruity; no off-flavors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>After ~12 hours&lt;/strong>, the aromas evolved a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #1 (control): still smelled like overripe, sugar-laden tropical fruits (pawpaws, guavas, mangoes, bananas, and oranges); intensely sweet and chocolaty; a little boozy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #2 (thiol boost+): the difference from control became more noticeable &amp;ndash; wildly sweeter, fruitier, and boozier. The chocolaty sweet aromas became a lot stronger, almost overwhelming, like Tootsie Rolls next to tropical fruits that were too far gone. All of the aromas from control were present, but 10x amplified. The caramelly sugary and chocolaty aromas became so immensely dominant that the fruity aromas became less pronounced.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The taste matured, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #1 (control): the sweetness deepened, reminiscent of chocolate, caramel, and maybe artificial sweetener, with heavy doses of overripe tropical fruit flavors; a slight bitter aftertaste.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #2 (thiol boost+): 50%-70% sweeter than control; stronger flavors of overripe fruits and alcohol, overpowering the chocolaty sweetness; less bitter aftertaste; didn&amp;rsquo;t taste as pleasant as it smelled anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Still no sign of fermentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>After ~24 hours&lt;/strong>, some tiny bubbles finally started to show up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aromas:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #1 (control): aromas of chocolate and caramel deepened further to smell more like Tootsie Rolls; citrus notes became more pronounced and pleasant (no more nauseatingly overripe fruits), inviting mental images of Tootsie Rolls on top of pineapples; boozy smell was gone.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #2 (thiol boost+): less Tootsie Roll, more &lt;em>fresh&lt;/em> tropical fruits picked at peak ripeness; a little grassy note, evoking mental images of tropical fruit salad atop a freshly mowed lawn.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Taste:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Barm #1 (control): a bit sweeter and a lot fruitier; mildly chocolaty and caramely; tasted like Tootsie Rolls and overripe tropical fruits; still a boozy undertone; the bitter aftertaste mellowed out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Barm #2 (thiol boost+): deeply Tootsie Roll; sweeter, fruitier, and more pleasant than earlier; a boozy undertone, reminiscent of vanilla-infused bourbon; the mild bitter aftertaste moved to the middle, right after the exorbitant sweetness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It seems biotransformation started (3-4 hours in) waaaay before any signs of fermentation showed up (~24 hours in).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>After ~48 hours&lt;/strong>, both barms were brimming with bubbles and nearly doubled in volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aromas:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #1 (control): about the same, with a clearer emphasis on Tootsie Rolls sweetness.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #2 (thiol boost+): about the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Taste:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Barm #1 (control): sweeter, fruitier, and much more pleasant; loads of fresh, perfectly ripe guava and pineapple, with a slightly tart finish; the citrus flavor moved to the foreground and became much more pronounced.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Barm #2 (thiol boost+): intensely fruity; a wide range of tropical fruits like pineapple, guava, mango, passion fruit, etc.; a brighter and much more pleasant flavor profile on the palate; a grapefruit-like metallic aftertaste.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I stirred both barms back down, and they came back up almost immediately.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For both doughs, I did&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>autolyse: 30 minutes at ~64¬∞F&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>bulk fermentation: 8 hours at ~70¬∞F&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>final proof: 16 hours at ~64¬∞F&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>bake: 45 minutes in total; 10 minutes @ 400¬∞F and 35 minutes at 350¬∞F.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The pungent tropical fruit aromas persisted into the final dough, carried over to my hands during dough-mixing, and stayed for hours after.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No tropical fragrance during baking, just typical bread crust aroma.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I let the baked breads rest for 12 hours before cutting.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What emerges from the spectral mist?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A wholegrain bread, transmogrified through fermentation by Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s London Tropics, with the addition of Thiol Boost, naturally releasing an aromatic phantasmagoria of ripe tropical fruits.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The aromas from the dough apparently persisted into the baked bread. Very little thermal degradation. Those who say beer yeasts lose their characters in breads are obviously not doing it right. LOL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To me, each bread tasted exactly like how it smelled, from barm to dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A panel of 3 taster (excluding me) donated their palates to this blind taste test. None of them was informed of the ingredients in the bread beforehand, only that it was not gluten-free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had so much fun watching the tasters' reactions. The panel&amp;rsquo;s combined description of these 2 breads:&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="bread-1">Bread #1&lt;/h5>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>aroma: massively sugary and chocolaty, with a fruity undertone, like some kind of fruit candy; one taster mentioned &amp;ldquo;caramel&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Tootsie Roll&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>flavor: mildly sweet; guava, passion fruit, and mango upfront, with a pineapple aftertaste and a little wheaty finish. All 3 tasters pointed out a weird artificial off-flavor, like artificially flavored water.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h5 id="bread-2">Bread #2&lt;/h5>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>aroma: immensely fruitier than bread #1; mainly overripe tropical fruits (ridiculous amounts of guava and passion fruit, with pineapple undertone); subtle chocolaty note (not as pronounced as in bread #1)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>flavor: pungently sickeningly fruity and sweet, like &amp;ldquo;fruit leather rolled in whole wheat.&amp;rdquo; One taster described it as &amp;ldquo;off-putting&amp;rdquo;, one said it was &amp;ldquo;disgusting&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;nearly inedible&amp;rdquo;, and the third one immediately screamed &amp;ldquo;something is wrong with this!&amp;rdquo; and had to spit it out. They all noted artificiality was much more outstanding in this loaf. An overdone POG bomb.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>All 3 tasters were able to tell these 2 breads apart, right away, despite identical crust and crumb textures. They unanimously preferred &lt;strong>bread #1 (the control)&lt;/strong> over bread #2 (thiol boost+), and said bread #1 was much more balanced and more pleasant to eat, comparatively. They enjoyed bread #1 as PB&amp;amp;J, but would not touch bread #2 again.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It was a tremendously fun bread experiment. The flavors from London Tropics are unmistakable. Tropical fruit characters were on steroids in these 2 loaves of thiol-enriched bread, especially in the one with a drop of Thiol Boost added.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tropics + Thiol Boost take fermentation and the end-product to an aroma blast of overripe exotic fruits, beyond realism. It transports you into a kind of infinity feeling. The fermentation goes through several stages, and you end up on a tropical island, touching down via &lt;a href="https://backtothefuture.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Fusion">Mr. Fusion-powered DeLorean time machine&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s tests have shown that Tropics strains are capable of biotransforming unhopped beers. My experiment confirms it can biotransform an &amp;ldquo;unhopped&amp;rdquo; bread (aka. solid beer).&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="thiol-dominant----thiol-complimentary">thiol-dominant &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; thiol-complimentary?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The aromas/flavors that are reported to fade away using Phantasm¬Æ remain very heavily in the end-product using Tropics + Thiol Boost. This could be the game-changing combo, instead of Phantasm + Omega.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These thiol-dominant breads turned out a bit too much (there&amp;rsquo;s apparently enough thiol precursors in the malts alone), so I think I&amp;rsquo;ll go light on thiols in the next experiment and make a thiol-complimentary bread, by&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>adding a lot of adjuncts in the mash starter (to decrease precursor load), or&lt;/li>
&lt;li>blending London Tropics with a traditional strain&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>to halve or even quarter thiol levels in the final bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for Thiol Boost, I might have to dip a toothpick in it and swirl the toothpick around in the mash to add just the tiniest hint of the booster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of info on internet homebrewing forums seems to suggest the biggest benefit of thiolized yeasts is that it enhances the aroma experience of a beer more than the flavor. I consider flavor to be a combination of taste and aroma. A more pleasant aroma inevitably leads our brains to interpret the overall flavor as better. Some people say they can&amp;rsquo;t decidedly tell the difference between thiol-boosted beers and those without. Well, I bet they won&amp;rsquo;t fail to notice the difference between these 2 loaves of &amp;ldquo;thiol bombs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="thiols-have-quirks-too">thiols have quirks, too&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Neither the panel of tasters nor I detected any wine-like aromas/flavors at all from Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s London Tropics and Thiol Boost (despite that bread #2 was an overdone POG bomb), but some brewers have reported a weird &lt;strong>white wine-ish character&lt;/strong> in their Phantasm¬Æ and Omega Thiolized¬Æ brews that detracts from the beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the wine industry figured out thiols way ahead of the beer industry and have already done a staggering amount of research on thiols, some brewers say these thiols are mostly wine-like, wine-adjacent or wine-related flavors &amp;ndash; synonymous with New Zealand-type hops (e.g. Nelson Sauvin‚Ñ¢ and Motueka‚Ñ¢) or even some new age European hops (i.e. Hallertau Blanc and Mandarina Bavaria). They can be awesome in the proper context, but they&amp;rsquo;re hardly a cheat code or shortcut (although they might save you 20% on hops, which probably nets to nothing per unit dollar spent). When does a beer become a grape ale? Perhaps brewers should step back and bear in mind that there are many more dimensions to a good beer, outside just a juicy burst of tropical aromas.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If you love wine, you&amp;rsquo;re gonna love this beer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Phil Humphrey, 608 Brewing Company&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now that almost every brewer is thiol-conscious, hopping every IPA with New Zealand-style hops or lupulin-enriched hop products, and boosting it with Phantasm powder, how are breweries going to &lt;strong>differentiate&lt;/strong> themselves?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There seems be a ceiling for the thiols&amp;hellip; Once you get there, it&amp;rsquo;s just all the same. Human &lt;strong>sensory threshold gets so saturated&lt;/strong> that stimuli no longer elicit an increased response. More isn&amp;rsquo;t better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of these thiols are produced by precursors found on the ingredients you put in. Some people have reported a &lt;strong>sulfury/diesely character&lt;/strong> in beers made with Phantasm and thiolized yeasts. Since the CSL expression is fairly non-specific (outside of its proclivity for cysteinylated substrates, as it can barely work on glutathionylated precursors), I&amp;rsquo;m guessing all types of bound sulfur-containing molecules are released by thiolized yeast, resulting in a sulfury aroma.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thiols &lt;strong>dissipate rather quickly&lt;/strong> over time, since free thiols are so sensitive to oxygen. I left bread #2 on the kitchen countertop, cut-side down, for ~2 days, and ~80% of the tropical fruit aromas vanished. Free thiols are found to be &lt;a href="https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:157890">almost entirely absent after 1 year&lt;/a> and as quickly as 6 months in some samples, likely due to their &amp;ldquo;high propensity to undergo oxidation, nucleophilic additions or substitutions.&amp;rdquo; Like life, thiols are fleeting. Best enjoy your thiolized brews while fresh.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="how-to-nuke-your-thiols">how to nuke your thiols&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s Tropics strains obviously already express enzymes that convert Glut-3MH to Cys-3MH during fermentation. More isn&amp;rsquo;t better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With these powerful thiolized yeasts,&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>loading additional precursors (especially Cys-3MH) through Phantasm or mash-hopping may be unnecessary (in this case, mash-hopping is likely to produce astringent vegetal off-flavors);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>late addition, or double/triple dry-hopping, with modern fancy hops, is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> a must (&amp;ldquo;hop creep&amp;rdquo; aside, these may even counterproductively reduce the impact of thiols);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>IPAs (double, triple, cold, New England, West Coast, etc.) are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> the only &amp;ldquo;thiol bombs&amp;rdquo; one can make. (I personally think thiols make more sense in simple blondes, &lt;em>witbiers&lt;/em>, and lagers.)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>A tiny amount of hops (as whirlpool additions) goes a long way towards complementing the thiol character &amp;ndash; unless the goal is to pack as many hops as possible into the beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To create unique, great-tasting breads/beers, you need to understand which bio-active compounds are present in the different ingredients you put in, how high their content is, how they affect aromas/flavors in the end-product, and how they change during the fermentation process and storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A while ago, Br√ºlosophy did a &lt;a href="https://brulosophy.com/2023/02/20/exbeeriment-impact-phantasm-powder-has-on-a-hazy-ipa/#more-142752">trial&lt;/a> with thiolized yeast and Phantasm thiol powder, and the results were quintessentially &amp;ldquo;inconclusive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Curiously, tasters in this xBmt were unable to reliably distinguish a Hazy IPA made with Phantasm powder from one made without it when both were fermented with thiolized yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In the trial, the author hopped the living crap out of the beer, which inevitably masks the flavor from the thiols and any benefit that the Phantasm thiol powder may bestow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems to me that guys at Br√ºlosophy often don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the value they are testing. For example, they did a pressure-fermentation test where the pressurized side was done at only 8 psi and transferred into an open keg &amp;ndash; basically nullifying the factors that make pressure-fermentation useful. They also did some direct comparisons of yeasts, using highly hopped beers. Of course, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to tell US-05 from BRY-97 in a triple IPA. And then peeps on the internet just eat their stuff up too much and take it as the gospel truth that yeast choice doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, rather than arrive at the correct conclusion &amp;ndash; one data point suggests that in hoppy ales, the yeast&amp;rsquo;s contribution to the flavor profile can be less perceptible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yeast matters. Just ask the Belgians.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Research on the evolutionary history of STA1 has shown the gene was not present in the wild ancestor of brewing yeast (&lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em>), but rather arose during the course of brewing &amp;ndash; formed by a mutation that fused two ancestral genes &amp;ndash; as an alternative evolutionary strategy for efficient utilization of sugars in brewer&amp;rsquo;s wort. The resulting diastatic strain (&amp;ldquo;STA1+&amp;rdquo;, i.e. &lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. diastaticus&lt;/em>) is able to consume complex sugars like oligosaccharides from dextrins and starches, which has allowed the strain to outcompete its ancestor. The STA1+ strains mainly rely on the Sta1p glucoamylase to break down maltotriose (unlike Ale/Beer 1 strains), which means these STA1+ strains will ferment fast initially when it gorges on glucose and maltose, but slow down as it moves on to consume maltotriose, since it produces low levels of Sta1p (hence the slow finish to the fermentation). &lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=182&amp;amp;type=YEAST&amp;amp;style_type=5">WLP644&lt;/a>, a Belgian strain, was originally thought to be &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> due to its funky character (e.g. low flocculation, tropical fruit esters, ability to form a pellicle, etc), but through DNA sequencing it was later revealed to be &lt;em>Saccharomyces&lt;/em>. Maybe not &lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em>, but genetically it doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong to &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em>. WLP644 is STA1+, but it&amp;rsquo;s among the strains with low diastatic ability, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6719335/">a 1162-bp deletion in the promoter of STA1&lt;/a>. Other closely related strains are the &amp;ldquo;Duvel&amp;rdquo; family (WLP570, WY1388, WB-06), which also tend to be slow fermenters. Diastaticus has been widely deemed a nasty contaminant in the brewing industry; cross-contamination often leads to unexpected over-attenuation, potentially exploding bottles or cans, and even &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2017/12/18/left-hand-brewing-milk-stout-nitro-damages/">lawsuits&lt;/a>.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

Based on how pungent the guava and passion fruit aromas were in my London Tropics-leavened breads, I thought it odd that Tropics would have added ATT since the paper showed that the addition seemed to reduce the total concentrations of 3MH &amp;amp; 3MHA. Additionally, Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230127053700/https://berkeleyyeast.com/available-yeast-strains/">strain catalog webpage&lt;/a> says all Tropics strains produce the CSL; there was no mention of the AAT at all. I was confused, so I reached out to Nick Harris, co-founder of Berkeley Yeast, for clarification. Nick explained to me that &amp;ldquo;the only gene that was inserted during the engineering was the CSL&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the addition of the AAT was into a strain that we have yet to commercialize.&amp;rdquo; Ah huh! So, whatever AATs present in the Tropics are native, not an exogenous addition. As for why Tropics produced more 3MHA, both in absolute and relative terms, than the strains possessing an additional AAT &amp;ndash; well, it still remains a mystery.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

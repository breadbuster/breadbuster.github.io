&lt;p>A few years ago I drove through Tucson, Arizona with a friend. We stopped by an unbelievably highly rated artisan bakery in town and tried a few different kinds of their bread (some loaves contained a small percentage of locally grown &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/white-sonora/">White Sonora&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/desert-gold-durum/">Desert Durum&lt;/a>). Each single one of these breads we got tasted like burnt toast. A big question mark popped into my head: Do professional bakers not know that they can score bread with beautiful designs &lt;em>without&lt;/em> burning it and making it so bitter, so hard to bite through the crust, and so tough to eat? I was more than disappointed because of all the hype. Literally every loaf needed to come out 10 minutes sooner. Luckily, the interior was decent enough to be edible; not great, still better than all the other bakeries in Tucson combined, which says a lot about bread culture in Tucson &amp;ndash; heck, city is better known for flour tortillas than levain. I swore next time I&amp;rsquo;d skip Tucson and check out some &lt;em>panaderías&lt;/em> in Sonora, Mexico instead. &amp;ldquo;Artisan&amp;rdquo; is one of the most used/abused words today; it just means &amp;ldquo;we are new to this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We kept on going along I-8 E towards San Diego. Soon after we crossed the Arizona-California state border, we passed the Imperial Valley, a sprawling patch in the Sonoran Desert, hemmed in by the Salton Sea to the north and Mexico to the south.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I probably would haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about the place again if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the Desert Durum® wheat.&lt;/p>

alt="pane nero with Desert Gold durum"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>handmade Desert Gold durum &lt;em>pane nero&lt;/em>: 100% wholegrain Desert Gold durum flour at 140% hydration, leavened with sourdough, flavored with nutty tahini, and coated in black sesame seeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Today the Imperial Valley produces more than half of the durum in California. Durum used to grown mainly in Siskiyou and Modoc Counties in the northernmost part of the state, until a few decades ago, when durum production moved to the southernmost part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Durum (&lt;em>Triticum turgidum, spp. Durum&lt;/em>) is an ancient variety of hard red spring wheat, a close relative of ancient emmer that is exceptionally hard &amp;ndash; hence the name &amp;ldquo;durum,&amp;rdquo; which is Latin for &amp;ldquo;hard,&amp;rdquo; and the species is the hardest of all wheats. As such, it requires significant force to mill into sandy-textured, golden-colored semolina for pasta and more finely ground durum flour for breads and pastries. Coupled with a high protein content (typically &amp;gt;12%), durum is a miller&amp;rsquo;s delight (or challenge).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Durum is genetically less evolved than the modern bread wheat (&lt;em>Triticum aestivum&lt;/em>), but stands out among other wheat varieties with its unique characteristics. Most of the durum grown today is amber durum; the grains are larger than other types of wheat berries, and have a beautiful amber color due to the extra carotenoid pigments (the naturally occurring compounds that give red, orange, and yellow vegetables their vibrant color), which also contribute to its distinct flavor that can be described as nuttier and slightly sweeter than modern wheat.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/california-dreamin-6/desert-durum-berries.jpg"
alt="Desert Gold durum wheat berries"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Desert Gold durum wheat berries, from the Imperial Valley of California. Durum wheat berries are the source of the semolina flour used to make one of the food staples of the world &amp;ndash; pasta &amp;ndash; as well as other traditional delicacies such as couscous and bulgur.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Durum has a yellow endosperm, which gives pasta its distinct color. When durum is initially milled, the endosperm is ground into a granular product called &lt;em>semolina&lt;/em>, which has a texture more like cornmeal and is ideal for pasta. Typically, the endosperm is separated from the bran and germ of the grain; only the endosperm is milled. It&amp;rsquo;s also possible to keep all the components, resulting in a wholegrain durum semolina.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have ever tried making Jeff Hamelman&amp;rsquo;s durum bread from his &lt;em>Bread&lt;/em>, you may have tripped over &amp;ldquo;durum flour.&amp;rdquo; This usually refers to very finely milled durum flour, aka. &lt;em>semola rimacinata&lt;/em> (remilled semolina, sometimes labeled &amp;ldquo;extra fancy&amp;rdquo; durum flour). After separating coarse durum midds, the semolina flour is re-milled several times until it resembles a fine powder. It&amp;rsquo;s the finest grind possible for durum and has the palest color, though it still looks yellow due to durum&amp;rsquo;s high carotenoid pigment concentration. Durum flour is great for softer-type noodles and some types of artisan bread that don&amp;rsquo;t require the elasticity of a high-rising flour. Again, durum flour can either be refined or wholegrain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite its relatively high protein content, durum&amp;rsquo;s gluten quality is different from that of modern bread wheat. While it forms a relatively stretchy dough, the dough structure tends to be fragile and weak, easily breaking down if mixed too much or fermented for too long. As such, breads made with mostly semolina or durum flours tend to have a dense and chewy texture. In some parts of the world, such as Altamura, Italy, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->durum breads&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> are beloved for that specific texture as well as distinct flavor.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>So why is durum so prized for pasta-making?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Texture&lt;/strong>: The main reason is the gluten in durum is strong but not particularly elastic, which means pasta made from this type of flour will keep its shape and the cherished &lt;em>al dente&lt;/em> texture after cooking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Taste&lt;/strong>: Durum has a delicious nutty flavor with an earthy aroma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Aesthetics&lt;/strong>: Durum has a rich golden color, which naturally evokes a happy feeling about the quality of the pasta and meals made with it. High-quality pasta awakens all the senses &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s an immersive experience to be savored.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>California is recognized for growing the best durum in the world. California durum varieties tend to have high yellow pigment, high gluten strength, and make a perfect &lt;em>al dente&lt;/em> whole-wheat pasta.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have ever enjoyed Barilla pasta in your favorite Italian dish, you have most likely consumed Desert Durum® wheat from Imperial County, CA. The Imperial Valley is the main location for the production of the Desert Durum®, a special type of durum with excellent quality that is highly demanded by various local and international pasta makers like Barilla Pasta. The success of the Desert Durum® wheat is owed to the hard work of UC-Davis professor and researcher, Jorge Dubcovsky.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Desert Gold is a Desert Durum® variety with high-yield potential and excellent pasta quality; it&amp;rsquo;s also well adapted to the San Joaquin Valley and the Imperial Valley of California. It&amp;rsquo;s very similar to Desert King, but has two genes for improved yellow pigment in pasta and one gene for reduced grain cadmium content (a beneficial human health trait).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be labeled as Desert Durum® commercially, the grain must be at least 90% produced under irrigation in the desert valleys and lowland of Arizona or California. These are areas of high temperatures (May-June temperatures average 90°F) and low rainfall (annual precipitation averages less than 200 mm). Desert Durum® is planted November through February and harvested in May and June.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="milling">milling&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Most of the durum produced (under irrigation) in the desert valleys and lowlands of Arizona and California are rated &lt;strong>No. 1 Hard Amber Durum (HAD)&lt;/strong>, a subclass of durum under the Official US Standards for Grain. HAD has &amp;gt;=75% hard, vitreous kernels of amber color, and sets the &amp;ldquo;gold standard&amp;rdquo; for premium pasta, couscous, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="Desert Gold durum vs. Joaquin Oro"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Desert Gold durum (left) vs. Joaquin Oro (right), both grown in California.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The vitreousness of durum wheat has traditionally been regarded by the wheat industry worldwide as an important quality factor. The average vitreous kernel content (HVAC) of Desert Durum® is &amp;gt;=90%. When compared to non-vitreous (starchy and piebald) kernels, vitreous kernels generally have improved cooking quality, better pasta color, coarser granulation, and higher protein content &amp;ndash; and thus sell at a premium. That comes with a string attached, of course: The glassy and translucent vitreous kernels are significantly harder to mill than the opaque starchy kernels, which are as hard as common bread wheats. (Piebald kernels are intermediate in protein content, but comparable in hardness to vitreous kernels.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never milled durum before, but I&amp;rsquo;ve often heard that durum milling is a complex procedure involving repetitive grinding and sieving, in order to obtain maximal semolina yield and the least amount of bran powder. Since the durum endosperm is extremely hard and vitreous, millers usually peel or pearl the kernels first to remove the outer layers of bran, to help improve the efficiency of durum processing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These Desert Gold durum berries shared by friends at the California Wheat Commission were super easy to mill. I ran them through a countertop electric WonderMill only once (on Bread Flour setting), and it turned out fine enough for my use.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="Desert Gold durum flour"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Freshly milled Desert Gold durum, unsifted. It smells nutty and toasty, like roasted chickpeas!&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I guess this first grind would be called &lt;em>semola di grano duro integrale&lt;/em> in Italy. The texture is somewhat gritty, less coarse than typical semolina but not as fine as flour. It has an amber yellow color and contains every part of the grain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OMG, freshly milled Desert Gold durum has such an intoxicating aroma, reminiscent of roasted chickpeas!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pane-nero">&lt;em>pane nero&lt;/em>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is my first durum bake in a looooong time. I made a loaf of 100% semolina sourdough bread ~3 years ago, and used semolina (&lt;em>rava&lt;/em>/&lt;em>suji&lt;/em>) from an Indian grocery store. That experiment gave me a good idea of how durum/semolina would behave in a bread dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time, I set my sight on delving into the flavorful versatility of durum. I would like to find out what makes whole durum wheat tick from both a milling and baking standpoint and how I might incorporate it into my freshly milled wholegrain repertoire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get the best flavor out of durum, you have to to push the limits. In my experience with durum, a long autolyse helps develop the dough; a ripe levain makes a better bread; after which, all it needs is a quick shape and bake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The conventional rules of thumb for baking with durum/semolina is 1) low hydration and 2) gentle mixing. For example, &lt;em>pane di Altamura&lt;/em> usually comes in at 65%-70% hydration and &lt;em>pane di Matera&lt;/em> at 70%-80%.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly keen on sticking to tried-and-true methods. I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and bake my interpretation of &lt;em>pane nero&lt;/em> (black bread from Sicily).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this bread:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>total Desert Gold durum milled: &lt;strong>400g&lt;/strong> (100%)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>total hydration: &lt;strong>560g&lt;/strong> (140%)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Using the same fine-mesh sieve that I used to bolt Turkey Red, I bolted 400g freshly milled wholegrain durum flour into&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>360g flour (90% extraction)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>40g coarse bits (10%)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s pretty high extraction for the first run through the mill.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="semolina-porridge">semolina porridge&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Given that the bran of the durum wheat kernel is actually thinner than most hard wheats &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s the starchy endosperm that&amp;rsquo;s actually the hardest to shatter &amp;ndash; the bigger pieces in wholegrain durum flour don&amp;rsquo;t always end up being mostly bran.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pre-cooking the coarse pieces will help bring out the wonderful flavors and nutrition benefits of the bran and the germ &amp;ndash; aromatic oils, minerals, and fiber, to name a few.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>

&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Desert Gold, coarse semolina&lt;/td>
&lt;td>100%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>40g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>whole milk&lt;/td>
&lt;td>300%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>120g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Process:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Toast the dry semolina mix in a 300°F oven (or in a skillet on the stovetop) for 3-4 minutes, until a slight toasty aroma hits your nose. This step is optional but will enhance the flavor enormously. Just be careful not to go overboard &amp;ndash; it will burn in a flash.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Put the toasties in a small pot and pour in milk; bring to a full boil, whisking frequently.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Reduce heat and simmer until a thick, creamy consistency. Turn off heat and let it cool off.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The semolina mix cooks fast &amp;ndash; the whole thing takes 10-15 minutes tops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You can make this in a microwave, too, just make sure to pause and stir frequently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any kind of milk will work. You can use plain water, too.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The porridge will also improve the texture of the baked bread through a process called &lt;em>starch gelatinization&lt;/em>, where starch and water meet heat, causing the starch molecules to swell. As a result, the water is gradually absorbed in an irreversible manner (&amp;ldquo;locked in&amp;rdquo;). This turns the mixture into a viscous and transparent gel, which is then used in sauces, puddings, creams and other food products to provide a pleasing texture. One of the most recognizable Chinese &lt;em>dim sum&lt;/em> delicacies, &lt;a href="https://tasteasianfood.com/har-gow/">&lt;em>har gow&lt;/em>&lt;/a> (shrimp dumplings), utilizes this technique to create an ultra-thin, translucent, and chewy skin. (The most common example to explain this phenomenon is pasta preparation: Pasta is made ​​mostly of semolina that contains high amounts of starch; when it&amp;rsquo;s cooked in boiling water, the size increases because it absorbs water and gets a soft texture.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I built the &lt;em>lievito madre&lt;/em> (20g sourdough starter + 40g water + 80g wholegrain durum flour) 8 hours before making the final dough, refreshing it every 3 hours or so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also toasted 1/2 of the black sesame seeds, leaving the other 1/2 raw for coating the dough.&lt;/p>

alt="Desert Gold durum dough"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Desert Gold wholegrain durum dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Process:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Autolyse&lt;/strong> @ ~70% hydration: Combine the flour with 252g water; mix until a shaggy mass; let autolyze for 6-8 hours (or overnight) in the fridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Levain&lt;/strong>: Squeeze the levain into the dough; mix until combined; let rest for 10-20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Double hydration&lt;/strong>: Add 100g or 2/3 of the remaining water gradually, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgz0oAhgwyg">Rubaud-mixing&lt;/a> (lifting, stretching, and dropping) until thoroughly absorbed. This requires a bit patience, so take your time. If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I&amp;rsquo;m good at, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>bassinage&lt;/em>. And I usually put on some &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlQWGGham__4sBxnwVyKbM8n91Xb9vwUG">music&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkB8eF4ATHl4Jm1BeCZgQ9A">podcasts&lt;/a> while I do this. Hand-mixing a dough is a type of alternative physical therapy; I find it tremendously therapeutic and cathartic. Gorging the dough with soooo much water feels like a crime, TBH. I keep going until the dough tells me to stop&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Salt&lt;/strong>: Mix in the salt. Then let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Semolina porridge&lt;/strong>: Divide the porridge into 3-4 portions; spread over the dough one portion at a time; mix until evenly distributed. With the porridge added back, no part of the grain is removed. Let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Triple hydration&lt;/strong>: Add the rest of the water, Rubaud-mixing until completely incorporated. Let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Tahini&lt;/strong>: Drizzle in the tahini, Rubaud-mixing until entirely combined.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cold ferment&lt;/strong>: Transfer the dough to a fridge (or somewhere 38°F-43°F) right away and ferment for 24 hours; take it out every few hours and perform a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JQm2n4aVZc">coil-fold&lt;/a> with a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds. I did 4 folds in total and folded in all of the toasted sesame seeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Shape &amp;amp; final proof&lt;/strong>: After 24 hours of bulk fermentation (~85% volume increase), shape the dough into whatever form you want. Roll it in the rest of black sesame seeds. Let it warm up to room temperature for 2-3 hours before baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The dough had a subtle toasty aroma, and surprised me with its softness and ease of handling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Artisanal boules look visually stunning, but are a &lt;em>de facto&lt;/em> pain in the butt to slice and freeze. Since I&amp;rsquo;m more pragmatic than artistic, I prefer the humble shape of a sandwich loaf &amp;ndash; much more space-efficient in the freezer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I shaped the dough into a log, proofed it seam-side up in a wide loaf pan, and baked with no scoring/slashing. The bread cracked open all on its own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind I baked this bread in my countertop toaster oven. It probably comes out prettier and crustier in a better oven with some fancy steaming apparatus &amp;ndash; or even a wood-fired oven.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The crumb has a marvelous golden color, light texture with a natural nutty flavor. Great to enjoy with with cheese and a glass of red wine.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>With a long fermentation and crispy aromatic sesame seeds (toasted during baking) on the outside, you get an irresistible bread that gives you the distinct flavors of the whole durum wheat, the chew from the hardness of this wheat (after all, it&amp;rsquo;s the wheat of choice for pasta), and its wonderful infusion with the toasted sesame seeds.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The crust is so thin and soft that it would be non-existent if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the sesame seeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each slice feels light, soft, and springy in my hand. It tastes soft like a brioche, chewy like a pasta; exceptionally smooth, custardy, and creamy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The flavor is subtly sweet, reminiscent of pasta, and does not taste like whole wheat at all. There is a hint of saltiness and tanginess.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Most of the &lt;em>pani puglisi&lt;/em> I have eaten in Italy have those characteristics: a high percentage of fine durum wheat, an light crumb with irregular holes, a very chewy texture, and a long keeping time (days and days).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The semolina porridge contributes a cotton-like softness to the crumb. As an extra perk, it improved the bread&amp;rsquo;s keeping quality (after it&amp;rsquo;s first sliced). During baking, the porridge releases water slowly, resulting in a continuous softening of both the crumb and the crust.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>How does this 100% whole durum bread compare to the semolina breads I made before? For starters, I could smell the difference during baking. Both had wonderful aromas, but the 100% whole durum version had a strikingly richer and more vibrant aroma that I didn&amp;rsquo;t recall from the semolina. On the inside, this wholesome version has a slightly juicier and softer crumb with a richer hue of yellow, thanks to the gorgeous load of the freshly milled wholegrain durum flour. Now, you can simply taste more of the grain &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s sweeter, nuttier, and to me, more satisfying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The durum bread is a perfect example of how you can take an already great grain &amp;ndash; especially freshly milled &amp;ndash; to the next level. hence the bread&amp;rsquo;s golden color &amp;ndash; it is a combination of coarsely milled semolina and finely milled durum flours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried a slice of this bread dipped in olive oil with a little balsamic vinegar. That was spectacular! The magical combination of flavors was delightful. I thought about using this bread in other characteristic Italian ways &amp;ndash; as garlic bread, toasted and smeared with almond butter, or eaten with a hearty &lt;em>ribollito&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; but didn&amp;rsquo;t get that far. The bread was gone in 2 days.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>If there is one bread that I wish everyone could taste to see how wonderful a freshly milled wholegrain bread can be, this may be it: Light, fluffy, and soft in texture, with an airy crumb; the rich, nutty, sweet durum flavor shines right through; and the crunch of the sesame seeds on the exterior offers a pleasing contrast against the tenderness of the interior.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Pane di Altamura&lt;/em> is probably the most famous &lt;em>pane pugliese&lt;/em> (bread from the Puglia region of Italy); it&amp;rsquo;s even a DOP product. Other interesting durum breads include &lt;em>pane di Matera&lt;/em> and &lt;em>pane nero&lt;/em>; I attempted to bake my interpretation of the latter in this breadpost.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

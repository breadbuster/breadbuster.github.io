Took the Old Canada Road Scenic Byway from Maine to Qu√©bec City, and felt like I had teleported across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Qu√©bec sits just below the Arctic, which means it&amp;rsquo;s literally frozen half of the year. Holy shit, winter in Qu√©bec is cold &amp;ndash; temperatures could easily drop to -35¬∞C (-31¬∞F) with the windchill. I had to get a parka. But I love how Canadians like to one-up each other over how cold their town is, as if winter was an acquired taste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But Qu√©bec &amp;ndash; especially la Ville de Qu√©bec &amp;ndash; at Christmastime is a true winter wonderland, full of &lt;em>joie de vivre&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s like Qu√©b√©cois have perfected the art of winter aversion therapy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Qu√©bec is quite different from the rest of Canada (sort of like Scotland vs. England, or Puerto Rico vs. the US mainland). It&amp;rsquo;s a wonder that they have stayed together for this long. Qu√©bec gets a bunch of benefits (e.g. tax revenue, currency, and a governmental framework) from Canada that its own constantly-impoverished legislature could never provide, and Canada gets to enjoy a slice of Europe in between Ontario and New Brunswick. Friends with benefits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Au Qu√©bec, on parle fran√ßais.&lt;/em> But my French is rusty. Qu√©bec&amp;rsquo;s language issues are too deep, and some places absolutely refuse to speak a word of English. I wanted to have a good time and experience Qu√©bec City like a local, so I brushed up on my &lt;em>fran√ßais&lt;/em> before arriving.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Holy poutine, Montmorency Falls is actually taller than Niagara Falls and absolutely stunning &amp;ndash; even in the winter. The ice toboggan at Le Ch√¢teau Frontenac was incredibly thrilling and fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The two cornerstones of the Qu√©b√©cois cuisine are bread and meat (particularly pork), both of which I&amp;rsquo;m fond of. So I had the good fortune of sampling many local gourmet foods made by &lt;em>les artisans charcutiers&lt;/em> and &lt;em>les boulangers des grains nobles&lt;/em>. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never had &lt;em>saucissons&lt;/em> (&amp;ldquo;French salami&amp;rdquo;) from La Ferme des Quatre-Temps and Charcuterie Charlevoisienne, or cheeses from Fromagerie des Grondines and Laiterie Charlevoix, then you haven&amp;rsquo;t lived!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found an interesting indie magazine on Qu√©b√©cois food culture, &lt;a href="https://cariboumag.com/">Caribou&lt;/a>. Oh, there&amp;rsquo;s also a 5-volume tome about the history of family cooking in Qu√©bec, &lt;em>Histoire de la cuisine familiale du Qu√©bec&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that Qu√©bec produces an overwhelming majority of the world&amp;rsquo;s maple syrup (&lt;em>sirop d&amp;rsquo;√©rable&lt;/em>), it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising Qu√©b√©cois drizzle maple syrup on everything, even the eggs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, I brought back some La Meunerie Milanaise wheat berries. No clue what specific cultivar these wheat berries are, other than some kind of hard red wheat grown in Qu√©bec. The nutrition label says it has 11.11% protein.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the Spring 2018 issue of Bread Lines, published by the Bread Baker&amp;rsquo;s Guild of America, La Milanaise whole wheat flour is a blend of hard red winter/spring wheats. The nutrition label says it has 11.67% protein. I doubt La Milanaise uses vastly different blends in its wheat berries and WW flours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The way the grain industry works in Canada reminds me a lot of America&amp;rsquo;s three-tier system of alcohol distribution: producers sell only to processors, who then &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->sell only through their distributors&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and distributors sell only to businesses. You rarely know which specific farm the grains come from, let alone meeting the farmers. You can&amp;rsquo;t buy La Milanaise products directly from La Milanaise anymore. You gotta find them at local retailers or place special orders through Avril Supermarch√© Sant√©.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I confess I hesitated about buying these wheat berries because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what cultivars they were or who grew them, which is against &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/about">my philosophy&lt;/a>, but I decided to fuck it because YOLO&amp;hellip;and it&amp;rsquo;s Canada where the face of flour is Robin Hood, owned by US multinational Cargill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also got some La Milanaise oat groats. Qu√©bec doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly grow a lot of oats. There are &amp;gt;=30 organic oat producers in eastern Qu√©bec, mostly in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and Bas-Saint-Laurent, but altogether they produce just ~5% of Canada&amp;rsquo;s oats. The Prairies (especially Saskatchewan) produces 93%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously, Canada is great at growing oats, but not so great at processing them. Most of them are exported as raw commodities. &lt;a href="https://oatcanada.com/">Oat Canada&lt;/a> gets its crops from Alberta, but only &lt;em>after&lt;/em> the oats have been shipped to a facility in the US or Europe and processed into a concentrated protein powder. That&amp;rsquo;s the Canadian way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something else I learned about Qu√©b√©cois grains: a few decades ago, nobody believed that quality bread wheat could be grown in Qu√©bec. The hot, dry summers of Western Canada produced hard spring wheat, which yielded the ideal flour for bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Just before the turn of the millennium, the move towards artisan bread was starting to take hold in Qu√©bec. Bakers from France arrived in droves, and had an excruciatingly hard time producing French breads locally with the strong flours (~14% protein) milled from hard spring wheat. A growing demand thus emerged for a type of wheat that didn&amp;rsquo;t interest the Western Canadian farmers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>La Milanaise, which started out as a mixed farming business in &lt;a href="https://lamilanaise.com/en/history/">the 1970s&lt;/a> in the village of Milan in the Estrie region, rose up to the challenge of filling that void. With strong government support, La Milanaise pioneered the organic grain industry in Qu√©bec and nurtured the province&amp;rsquo;s wheat culture. Qu√©bec now dominates organic farming growth in Canada, and produces winter wheat with far more complex aromas than spring wheat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>La Milanaise has become a leading &lt;em>processor&lt;/em> of organic grains in Canada, exporting grain products to the US, Europe and Latin America. It sources &amp;gt;=60% of its grain from Qu√©bec farmers, and only purchases out West what cannot be grown locally. (Obviously, agriculture is heavily subsidized and protected by &lt;em>le gouvernement du Qu√©bec&lt;/em>.) It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell which La Milanaise grains are grown in Qu√©bec and which are from elsewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, La Milanaise has joined hands with Qu√©b√©cois bakery chain Premi√®re Moisson to found another mill, &lt;a href="https://moulinsdesoulanges.com/language/en/home/">Les Moulins de Soulanges&lt;/a>, to develop specialty flours tailor-made to the needs of Qu√©b√©cois artisan bakers. Flours from La Milanaise are featured in Daniel Leader&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Local Breads&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not as keen on pre-milled flours as whole grains. But I did stop by Premi√®re Moisson (majority-owned by supermarket chain Metro since 2014) on Boulevard Lebourgneuf and got a WW buckwheat bread with Charlevoix hemp seeds. It was delicious and I felt fuckin' Canadian.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So I made a bread with La Milanaise grains:&lt;/p>

&lt;tr>

&lt;td>45%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Grade A dark maple syrup (Escuminac)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>10%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>grey Gu√©rande salt&lt;/td>
&lt;td>1%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>raisins (&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->NaturellementBio&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>10%&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>I did the usual 24-hour cold ferment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole wheat flour milled from La Milanaise wheat berries is very soft, but not as &lt;em>rouge&lt;/em> as Turkey Red.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The bread is very aromatic during and after baking. The crust smells like caramel, chocolate and roasted nuts. The crumb is light, open and soft.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It tastes sweet and creamy, with some toasty wheatiness.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Madame Beno√Æt, a 20th-century Qu√©b√©cois food writer, once said:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A recipe is only a theme, which an intelligent cook can play each time with a variation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I wholeheartedly agree with her.&lt;/p>

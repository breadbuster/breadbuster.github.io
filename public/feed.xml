&lt;p>Key West, the southernmost point of the continental US, is one of my favorite summer spots. Ernest Hemingway once said Key West was &amp;ldquo;a St. Tropez of the poor.&amp;rdquo; He came for a day and ended up staying for a decade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The island is still a source of endless joy: fishing, scuba diving, dancing, slumming, and drinking. The most beautiful thing about Key West is spending the night on the beach (not the best in Florida), swimming there as if it were daytime, and tanning, like vampires, under the moonlight. And I always like to bring &lt;em>medianoches&lt;/em> and &lt;em>chicharones&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time, I drank lots of corn. First of all, a fermented &lt;em>chicha morada&lt;/em> (I can&amp;rsquo;t stand the sweet and fruity non-fermented version), made with Peruvian purple corn, pineapple, apples, lime, and spices. It tasted like a &lt;em>kombucha&lt;/em>. Next, a &lt;em>chicha venezolana&lt;/em>, which turned out more like a Mexican &lt;em>horchata&lt;/em>. On my way out, I drank homemade &lt;em>chicha de jora&lt;/em> and ate &lt;em>estofado de carne&lt;/em> (rich and flavorful beef stew with garden vegetables and &lt;em>chicha de jora&lt;/em>); the stew reminded me of &lt;em>bœuf bourguignon&lt;/em> and was a lot better than this Ohio &amp;ldquo;delicacy&amp;rdquo; called Cincinnati chili 3-way I had earlier at Skyline just outside Fort Lauderdale, which is a pound of shredded cheese on top of mediocre chili on top of poorly cooked spaghetti.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These brought back good memories of backpacking in Peru and eating at &lt;em>picanterías&lt;/em>, where &lt;em>chicha morada&lt;/em> and &lt;em>chicha de jora&lt;/em> are commonly brewed in-house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Chicha&lt;/em> is an ancient pre-Columbian corn drink widespread in the Andes. It was absolutely essential to the Incas; for them it was a fundamental domestic product, traded from coast to inland, up and down the continent. &lt;em>Chicha&lt;/em> was a community necessity, a ritual libation, an imperative social lubricant to the Incas' communication with the gods, a drink worthy of being sipped by a farmer straight out of a clay pot as well as lapped up by the sun itself out of a gold vessel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The brewing process for &lt;em>chicha&lt;/em> is essentially &lt;a href="https://beerconnoisseur.com/articles/chicha-bolivias-tart-beer">similar&lt;/a> to that of European-style beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Doña Leonor Mariscal, 70 years old, does just that for her fellow villagers. In her tiny ramshackle building, once a chicheria itself, she steeps the corn and lets it germinate a bit on a large piece of cloth laid out in the sun, directly on the cobblestone street in front of her building. The sun is sometimes hot enough to dry out her corn malt, but she admits to using ashes sometimes to complete the process. She then bags the malt and lets the area chicha brewers grind this corn into a flour at their own breweries. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fermentation therefore seems to be nearly entirely carried out by the natural content of the corn. Many traditional cochabambina brewers like Doña Narcissa do not seem aware that the lactic acid bacteria contained within the corn is the true origin of the alcohol, light fizz and acidic flavor of their brew. But what matters is that they are always able to quench chicha lovers' thirst for delicate tartness; the science behind their brewing methods isn&amp;rsquo;t a major concern.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Outside Latin America, the one thing most people remember about &lt;em>chicha&lt;/em> is that it&amp;rsquo;s often fermented with human saliva. In particular, &lt;em>chicha de jora&lt;/em> (&lt;em>jora&lt;/em> is a specific kind of yellow maize) is typically prepared by chewing said corn into a clump before fermenting it into a boozy concoction. Since the starch in corn is well locked into the grain kernel and thus unavailable for fermentation on its own, chewing allows the enzymes (e.g. amylases) in your mouth to break down the starch into sugar.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The chewing inevitably raises many eyebrows. The idea of consuming a drink brewed from someone else&amp;rsquo;s saliva is viscerally disturbing, particularly in the post-COVID era. Using saliva as a fermentation starter is not unique to South America, however; there&amp;rsquo;s evidence that chewing as a way of kicking off fermentation was practiced in prehistoric Europe before the emergence of malting; Finnish folklore tells the legend of a woman by the name of Kalevatar, who invented beer by mixing honey with bear saliva; some traditional Japanese &lt;em>sakes&lt;/em>, such as &lt;em>kuchikamizake&lt;/em> (口噛み酒, meaning &amp;ldquo;mouth-chewed &lt;em>sake&lt;/em>&amp;quot;), are made from chewed rice; and &lt;em>kava&lt;/em>, produced by the peoples of the Pacific Islands from chewing the roots of kava (aka. &lt;em>Piper methysticum G. Forst&lt;/em>), was born in this way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fetishes and aesthetics aside, saliva contains diverse microbiomes, and each person&amp;rsquo;s saliva is different and therefore gives different flavors to the fermented product.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been smitten with grain corns. You may remember the loaf of &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-4/">blue corn bread&lt;/a> I made with East Coast ale yeast a few weeks ago. This time, inspired by the wonderful Peruvian corn dishes and drinks I had in Key West, I&amp;rsquo;d like to up the corn percentage and make a Portuguese-style &lt;em>broa de milho&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="corn-mash">Corn mash&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some brewers have described dealing with malted corn as &amp;ldquo;pure, unadulterated pain from hell&amp;rdquo; that comes in many folds:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Malted corn has low diastatic power &amp;ndash; barely 35 °L. That&amp;rsquo;s hardly enough to fully convert itself, and requires exogenous amylase from either malted barley or powdered additive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Corn has a higher gelatinization temperature than barley to break apart the starch molecules. Boiling corn would do the trick. However, high temperatures will kill those natural enzymes meant to convert the starches to fermentable sugars.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Also, while corncobs as a whole do have husks, the corn kernels do not contain husks, making lautering comparable to the 9th layer of hell. Luckily, this challenge doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in solid beer (aka. bread).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Undermodifed malts, including corn, have dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in spades, so when you combine the two you may develop unpleasant off-flavors if the proper precautions aren&amp;rsquo;t taken.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>You know, none of this sounds that excruciating to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you really are a single-malt purist, you will&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>chew the corn to break it into smaller bits for the mash and add the enzymes from your saliva that will break down the starches to sugars; or&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>go through European-style triple-decoction mashing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you aren&amp;rsquo;t that much of a purist, then you need to add exogenous enzymes. One way is to add dry amylase powder; another is to use some pale barley malt to get the enzymes.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I wanted to do the single-malt triple-decoction mashing, because mashing is fun and I had never done an all-corn mash before.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>ingredient&lt;/th>

&lt;th>weight&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>yellow corn malt (Grouse Malt House)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>100%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>375g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>tap water&lt;/td>
&lt;td>87.2%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>327g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Total: 702g&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since maize doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain large amounts of phytase, acid rest isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started the mixture at ~125°F where I left it for 2 hours (protein rest). Then I decocted 1/3 of the mash and boiled it for 2 minutes. I tasted a small sample of the decoction &amp;ndash; it was insanely sweet, and reminded me of a Southern cornbread but slightly more starchy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a few minutes, I added the boiled decoction back to the main mash and it raised the temperature to 150°F. I held the mash at ~150°F for the next 5 hours, turning the stove top burner on occasionally to keep the temperature consistent. Further sweetness didn&amp;rsquo;t begin to manifest until the end of it, with plenty of residual starchiness. So I decocted 1/3 of the mash again, and boiled for 2 minutes; when I returned the decoction to the main mash, it brought up the temperature to 158°F, where I left it for another 2.5 hours. Lastly, I decocted 1/3 of the mash again, raising the temperature of the main mash to 168°F &amp;ndash; and held it there for 1 hour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After all that, starch was no longer perceivable to my tongue. The saccharified corn mash had the fragrance of sweet corn cookies, with intriguing background notes of chestnuts. It tasted insanely sweet and malty, and had a distinct caramelized corn flavor &amp;ndash; almost like a corn muffin. I quite enjoyed the mash, and honestly could have devoured it as is (like a breakfast porridge or dessert).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="corn-barm">Corn barm&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once the saccharified corn mash had cooled off to body temperature, I measured 150g out into a separate bowl for yeast inoculation, reserving the remaining 552g in the fridge until needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>

&lt;td>1.5g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Total: 151.5g&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Framgarden expresses a tropical profile with lots of pineapple leading the way and subtler notes of hay and white pepper in the background.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Escarpment&amp;rsquo;s recommended temperature range for Framgarden is quite wide (68-95°F). I let the inoculated mash ferment, loosely covered, at 80-85°F for 12 hours.&lt;/p>

&lt;tr>
&lt;td>London Tropics liquid yeast (Berkeley Yeast)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>100%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>75g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Total: 150g (100% extraction = whole grain)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mixed the wholegrain rye flour with the yeast slurry until thoroughly hydrated, and let the mixture ferment (loosely covered) at ~68°F for 12 hours. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect this to biotransform or ferment much &amp;ndash; it was more of a soaker (à la Peter Reinhart&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Whole Grain Breads&lt;/em>) that utilized excess liquid yeast, in this case, to thoroughly hydrate the whole grains and enhance flavors in the final bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh boy, biotransformation kicked off as soon as I mixed everything together; the artificial fruit aroma didn&amp;rsquo;t get as overwhelming as in my first &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">POG bomb&lt;/a>, but very noticeable. I started to regret underestimating this &amp;ldquo;weapon of mass thiolization&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After ~12 hours, the soaker showed slight signs of fermentation and smelled pungently fruity &amp;ndash; Mr. Fusion-powered DeLorean time machine was back in full stride. A hyperrealistic simulacrum. A hallucinatory fantasy. It reminded me of a quote from Jean Baudrillard:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What every society looks for in continuing to produce, and to overproduce, is to restore the real that escapes it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Interestingly, Untitled Art in Waunakee, WI just released a &lt;a href="https://www.drinkuntitled.com/product/non-alcoholic-berliner-weisse/">non-alcoholic &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em>&lt;/a> brewed with London Tropics, de-alcoholized with membrane filtration technologies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since thiols are more soluble in alcohols than in water, doesn&amp;rsquo;t the filtration remove quite a bit of the thiols as well? I wonder how much of the fruity aroma/flavor from Tropics remains in the NA beer. As far as I know, de-alcoholization generally removes the fermentation products &amp;ndash; which can be added back in, but that process can be pretty violent to the flavor structure of the beer and, most notably, quite expensive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t arrested fermentation (e.g. interrupting full attenuation) with Tropics make more sense in producing NA beers? In my bread experiments, London Tropics kicks off biotransformation waaaay before attenuation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>(100% extraction = whole grain)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mixed all of the ingredients together into a homogeneous dough, and let it ferment at ~73°F for 2 hours. Then I shaped it into a &lt;em>boule&lt;/em>, and placed it in a proofing colander liberally coated with toasted oat bran. The dough was left to proof at ~58°F for 14 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I got the BBQ grill to 400°F, I flipped the dough into a cast-iron skillet and slid it onto the grill. I added black walnut shells to the bottom of the grill, closed the lid, and let the bread bake at 400°F for 1 hour.⁠&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Summer is a completely different experience when you know how to grill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crust came out thick, smoky, charred, and crunchy; the inside moist and tender, plush with a flavor that absolutely reverberated with corn. Mouthfuls of smokiness, too. The tropical fruit profile got subdued by the wonderful smoky flavor of open-fire bakery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s that perfect, forever corn bread that I want to bring to the beach. The summer wish I never knew I had.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This corn bread went so well with summer salads and snacky things. I took it to a park today, along with some butter (not optional), and enjoyed the hell out of it under a tree, while watching the clouds float across the sky.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m surprised how many people watch only HBO and whatever the Netflix algorithm recommends. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like the folks who email me asking factual questions &amp;ndash; have they never heard of the internet? There&amp;rsquo;s a vast cornucopia of streaming series out there; if you pick the right one, your life will be enhanced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last night I watched the final two episodes of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farzi">Farzi&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; while licking a plate of buttery &lt;a href="https://authenticsimplifiedrecipes.wordpress.com/2019/02/21/pav-bhaji/">&lt;em>pav bhaji&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. When the show was over, I spontaneously exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;That was great!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Frankly, not as great as &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bureau_(TV_series)">&lt;em>Le Bureau des Légendes&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2324587/">&lt;em>Počivali u miru&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, but really fulfilling. And it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find those shows these days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Farzi&amp;rdquo; is about the rigid caste system in India, where upward mobility is extremely limited. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t dream. Opportunities are closed. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you&amp;rsquo;re not smart or willful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most people are so addicted to brands (e.g. HBO or Apple TV+). They watch only light stuff like comedy; they say real life is daunting enough, they don&amp;rsquo;t want to be brought down by a show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s what life is all about: new experiences, stretching your horizons, because otherwise you&amp;rsquo;d end up living on repeats, waiting to die.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with uncommon grains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wheat has been the hegemony in the bread world, while barley reigns supreme in the brewing industry. Malt has become synonymous with barley the way that flour has with wheat, but malt can be made from any type of (pseudo)grain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="buckwheat">Buckwheat&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The only exposure most people in the West have to buckwheat is in pancakes, which is quite sad.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Buckwheat (&lt;em>Fagopyrum sagittatum syn. F. esculentum&lt;/em>) is a curious and misunderstood food. It&amp;rsquo;s not a &amp;ldquo;wheat&amp;rdquo;, but is treated like one. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a shrub, related to rhubarb; it produces seeds on the flower heads. These seeds (or kernels) are what get ground into flour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like other seeds, buckwheat is high in both protein (18% by weight!) and fiber, but it&amp;rsquo;s unique among the seeds we typically eat, because it&amp;rsquo;s mainly composed of carbs, with lower fat and higher starch content than, say, sunflower seeds or chia seeds. IMO, buckwheat has a well-balanced starch, protein, fat, and mineral composition, and is absolutely delicious. Hands-down one of my favorite &amp;ldquo;cereals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buckwheat was long thought to have originated in central Asia, somewhere between Lake Baikal and Manchuria. Recent &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02861199">research&lt;/a> now leans toward southwest China and the Himalayan region as the center of origin. The two cultivated species of buckwheat, &lt;em>Fagopyrum esculentum&lt;/em> (common buckwheat) and &lt;em>Fagopyrum tataricum&lt;/em> (tartary buckwheat) are Chinese domesticates, presumably originating in upland southwest China, outside the major rice and millet centers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buckwheat is known as &lt;em>grano saraceno&lt;/em> in Italian and &lt;em>sarrasin&lt;/em> in French, leading the late food writer Waverly Root to assume that buckwheat originated in Asia Minor and was introduced by either the Turks, the Crusaders, and/or the Moors to places in Europe where other grains didn&amp;rsquo;t grow well and where the people ate &amp;ldquo;robustly&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; such as Brittany, Finland, Styria, central France and the Tyrolian Alps. Europeans of the Middle Ages, however, used the term &amp;ldquo;saracen&amp;rdquo; to describe many things that simply came from the East, whether they were Arabian or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the contemporary Italian botanist Valerio Giacomini, who has made a thorough study of buckwheat, there are three possible ways buckwheat arrived in Europe:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>through southern Russia, Poland, and Germany &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Belgium and France;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>through Turkey &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Greece, Hungary, and southern Russia; and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>through the maritime contacts of Venice, which might explain in part the ascription of &amp;ldquo;saracen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There is a legend that Joos van Ghistele brought it back with him from his journey to the Holy Land in 1485. Who knows. In any case, the origin of buckwheat is unknown, even if its name in Latin languages suggests an Arab provenance. The plant&amp;rsquo;s English name, &amp;ldquo;buckwheat&amp;rdquo;, came from the Dutch word for &amp;ldquo;beech&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em>boec&lt;/em>) and wheat, because it can be used in food, like wheat.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>What seems certain, though, is that buckwheat has been a traditional food around the world, particularly in regions with short growing seasons and poor soil. Eastern Europeans eat a porridge of toasted buckwheat groats (&lt;em>kasha&lt;/em>). In the mountainous valley of Lombardy, Italy, a traditional winter dish is &lt;em>pizzoccheri&lt;/em>, basically short buckwheat pasta tossed with butter, cabbage, cheese, garlic, and sage &amp;ndash; a poor &amp;ldquo;peasant&amp;rdquo; tradition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buckwheat has a rich history in the United States as well, unlike other ancient grains. It was common during the Colonial era, but began to decline in popularity after the Civil War ended.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="malted-buckwheat">Malted buckwheat&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I had the good fortune of experimenting with some caramel buckwheat malt from &lt;a href="https://grousemalthouse.com/">Grouse Malt House&lt;/a>, a dedicated gluten-free craft malthouse in Wellington, Colorado. (I was not looking for gluten-free alternatives &lt;em>per se&lt;/em>, but rather malts made from uncommon grains. Grouse has been crafting a ton of those since ~2013.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dark, triangular-shaped hulls covering the buckwheat seeds are left on, to help brewers lauter/filter more easily. The hull is very tough, but is edible when ground and provides a good source of fiber. Even after soaking and boiling, though, unhulled buckwheat is too chewy and too earthy for most people&amp;rsquo;s palates.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This malt, out of the box, smelled like a forest right after a rain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Buckwheat can be milled with or without the hull. The traditional method is milling with the hulls. And yes, some millers even add extra hulls. Flour ground from unhulled buckwheat will be greyish, with tiny black specks &amp;ndash; it looks darker and tastes a tad stronger than flour made from hulled buckwheat (groats).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When freshly ground, this caramel buckwheat malt has an unmistakable earthy aroma &amp;ndash; it creates a woodsy vibe that&amp;rsquo;s bold but not overly aggressive, evoking mental imagery of a deep, verdant forest. There&amp;rsquo;s also a little sunflower seed-like nutty aroma. It tastes predominantly earthy &amp;ndash; like unmalted buckwheat or yellow split peas &amp;ndash; with a hint of malty sweetness. Just how I like my buckwheat, despite the lack of a quintessential &amp;ldquo;caramel&amp;rdquo; malt vibe.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Many Westerners don&amp;rsquo;t like that robust flavor of unhulled buckwheat. So there&amp;rsquo;s a large market for buckwheat flour &lt;em>sans&lt;/em> the hulls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know pretty well how buckwheat performs and tastes in food, but in beer? I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure. Enzymatic activities are &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228618138_The_Impact_of_Kilning_on_Enzymatic_Activity_of_Buckwheat_Malt">found&lt;/a> to be low in pale buckwheat malt. I would probably agree with what &lt;a href="https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/buckwheat-questions.449416/#post-5789674">this brewer&lt;/a> said about buckwheat:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I suspect that you will be disappointed with the flavor and diastatic power of pale-malt buckwheat, though. If my experience with Colorado Malting Company&amp;rsquo;s buckwheat malt is any indicator, about the only way to coax any flavor out of it is to make crystal malt; but even that doesn&amp;rsquo;t do much, considering very little saccharification takes place during the crystal-making process so you don&amp;rsquo;t get much in the way of caramelized sugars. The only use I have for buckwheat in my beers is unmalted as an adjunct to improve head retention (the malted stuff doesn&amp;rsquo;t do as well in that regard due to changes in protein contents), or else roasted really dark, as a stand-in for Briess &amp;ldquo;Midnight Wheat&amp;rdquo; to impart a smooth roast character to darker beers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Which is why I picked &amp;ldquo;caramel&amp;rdquo; buckwheat malt, not the other two buckwheat options (BK1001 pale and BK1100 roasted) offered by Grouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Caramel malt is typically made from &amp;ldquo;green malt&amp;rdquo; (wet germinated malt) or rehydrated base malt, mashed at 140-160°F so that the amylase in each individual grain kernel degrades the starch within into simple sugars, and subsequently dried out at &amp;gt;=170°F, which causes the sugars inside the malt to crystallize. It also causes the sugars and nitrogen-based compounds (mostly amino acids and proteins) to combine to form melanoidins. The major variable in the process is the kilning temperature, which determines the depth of the color and the degree of caramelization. The higher the drying temperature, the darker the color will be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During roasting, most (if not all) of the enzymes in the malt become denatured, and many of the sugars in the malt become caramelized and thus unfermentable, which is why caramel malt is usually used (like an adjunct) to add sweetness and body to the finished beer, instead of as a base malt.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="buckwheat-mash">Buckwheat mash&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In &amp;ldquo;caramel&amp;rdquo; malts made from common grains like barley and wheat, the starch is already gelatinized and saccharified in the core. Malted buckwheat gelatinizes at a temperature that is higher than that at which the amylase becomes denatured. To get any significant fermentables out of buckwheat, a decoction mash or exogenous enzymes may be necessary. Andrew Lavery has some &lt;a href="https://glutenfreehomebrewing.com/lavery_brewing_tutorial.php">good info&lt;/a> on mashing gluten-free grains.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I mixed everything together and did a triple-decoction mash starting at 95°F:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>30 minutes at 95°F&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 hour at ~113°F&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 hour at ~130°F (decocted 1/3 at the end; boiled for 5 minutes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 hours at ~150°F (decocted 1/3 at the end; and boiled for 5 minutes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 hour at ~160°F (decocted 1/3 at the end; boiled for 5 minutes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 hour at ~170°F&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The buckwheat malt soaks up water like a sponge, so this mash turned out very thick. It smelled mildly sweet and smoky, reminiscent of toasted sesame seeds. Not at all what you&amp;rsquo;d expect with a typical &amp;ldquo;caramel&amp;rdquo; malt made from barley or wheat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After saccharification, the mash tasted sweet-ish and boldly buckwheaty.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="buckwheat-barm">Buckwheat barm&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A lot of people consider the flavor of buckwheat to be in the same general category as rye, but far more rustic, earthy, and flavorful than any of the routinely used grains. Part of that character derives from buckwheat&amp;rsquo;s caprylic acid content. Caprylic acid (octanoic acid) is a medium-chain fatty acid that is naturally found in palm oil, coconut oil, and milk. It&amp;rsquo;s a part of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) products, and believed to have potent antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. FYI, &lt;em>capr&lt;/em>- comes from Latin &lt;em>capra&lt;/em>, meaning &amp;ldquo;goat&amp;rdquo;; a lot of people say buckwheat adds a load of &amp;ldquo;goaty&amp;rdquo; flavor, which I disagree with.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>One great thing about some &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo;-tasting fatty acids is that they provide appealing aromas after &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> combines them with a molecule of ethanol to form an ester. Buckwheat has been &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228761224_Processing_of_a_Top_Fermented_Beer_Brewed_from_100_Buckwheat_Malt_with_Sensory_and_Analytical_Characterisation">researched&lt;/a> for its possible caprylic acid contribution to &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> fermentation, during which the Brett might convert these fatty acid precursors to create ethyl caprylate, an ester often described as sweet, waxy, floral, fruity, pineapple, and wine.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I added 1g of liquid &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220925144154/https://escarpmentlabs.com/products/the-kveik-ring-kolnasata">Kolnasāta&lt;/a>, a continental European farmhouse ale yeast sourced from Bērzpils, Latvia by Escarpment Labs.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Kolnasāta is traditionally used to &lt;a href="https://www.kulinaraismantojums.lv/en/biedri/home-producers/production-of-home-brewed-beer-kolnasata/">brew beers at home in Latgale&lt;/a> (aka. the land of blue lakes), a historical region in eastern Latvia. The brewing usually takes place in wooden tuns, and calls for locally-grown barley malt that&amp;rsquo;s dried in a smoke sauna.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This yeast is expected to produce &amp;ldquo;ample doses of pineapple esters along with medium attenuation and flocculation.&amp;rdquo; I thought this profile would pair well with the other yeasts I was going to add to the barm later on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Escarpment&amp;rsquo;s recommended temperature range for Kolnasāta is 68-86°F, so I let the inoculated mash (aka. barm) ferment, loosely covered, at 80-84°F for 12 hours. The barm began to show signs of fermentation and exude a subtle fruity aroma like peach and pineapple.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Next, I added 0.9g of London Tropics from Berkeley Yeast. This London ale yeast-derived thiolized strain produced a POG bomb in a &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">previous experiment&lt;/a>, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to tone down the thiol level this time to see how the final bread might turn out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s recommended temperature range for London Tropics is 64-72°F. I let the barm ferment at 66-70°F for 24 hours. By the end, the thick mash had nearly risen by 50%-70% and felt fluffy. It smelled much more fruity, pleasantly balanced between guava and pineapple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Stage 3: Brettanomyces&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I intended to add 2g of &lt;em>Brettanomyces bruxellensis&lt;/em>. Due to a squirting accident with the homebrew pouch, I ended up adding 6g of the liquid yeast. The 6% inoculation rate was not intentional, but it is what it is.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Total: 187.9g&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I let this barm sit in my fermentation fridge (set to ~45°F) for 4 days. The barm puffed up like my Italian &lt;em>lievito madre&lt;/em>, and developed a more complex aroma that was very pleasing, but hard to put into words.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Flavor-wise, it was predominantly earthy buckwheat (reminding me of toasted black sesame seeds), with a charming malty character and mildly fruity undertone. I liked it, a lot. While biting into it, I pictured myself in a hammock swaying on a sun-soaked island in the Black Sea.&lt;/p>

Otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s probably an acquired taste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I guess quartering thiol levels in this bread worked out well. Once again, more isn&amp;rsquo;t (always) better. It&amp;rsquo;s all about understanding what you want to achieve and how your yeast will behave. Recipes are very overrated.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Given a lot more thiol precursors come from malts than hops, it probably makes more sense to play with different base malts and malt varieties than with new age hops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>German scientists have devised &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c06305">a solvent-free, automated method&lt;/a> for brewers to measure and track hop-derived thiols during the brewing process. How cool would it be, to be able to quantify the amount of thiol precursors in different malts, and find out which malt varieties pair the best with a particular thiolized yeast?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Most maltsters don&amp;rsquo;t list information about their grain varieties, only generic info like the malt type (pale, pilsner, crystal, etc). To find out the specific varietals of grains the malts are made from, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to ask the maltsters directly for COAs (certificates of analysis).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with enough grains (of different varieties) to know that the varietal can make a big difference in the end-product, e.g. a bread made from 100% &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/turkey-red/">Turkey Red&lt;/a> is noticeably different from one made from 100% &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/joaquin-oro/">Joaquin Oro&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/white-sonora/">Sonora Blanca&lt;/a>. In pale ales, modern barley varieties like Metcalfe and Copeland from Montana or western Canada may be more suited to the American style than the others, while heirloom varieties like Golden Promise or Maris Otter add a bit of nutty character to British variations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many brewers proudly describe their base malts &amp;ndash; the vast majority of the grist in most beers &amp;ndash; simply as &amp;ldquo;2-row.&amp;rdquo; That label merely indicates it&amp;rsquo;s not the &amp;ldquo;inferior&amp;rdquo;, higher-protein 6-row barley variety. But those are broad categories &amp;ndash; just like &lt;a href="https://newenglandapples.org/2020/10/16/russets-small-size-big-flavor/">russet&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.chelseagreen.com/2022/surprisingly-sweet-crab-apples/">crab&lt;/a>, and club are categories of apples (so much for the Johnny Appleseed fairy tale) &amp;ndash; and imply nothing about the actual barley variety, even less about how the grain is malted. Most brewers just take whatever malt variety is available, maybe occasionally thinking about 2-row vs. 6-row, winter vs. summer, maltster vs. maltster, and US-Canada vs. Europe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As with wheat, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that if a malt is generic enough to be characterized by just its category, it&amp;rsquo;s not going to give the end-product much flavor or character. But what really made me appreciate malt as a craft, in and of itself, was 2 things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Learning how to make traditional Baltic peasant rye bread from single-variety grain (rye) during 2020 COVID lockdown. In rural villages in Belarus and Latvia, for example, grandmas still make some of the world&amp;rsquo;s most flavorful (and underrated) breads today &amp;ndash; with only rye flour, water, salt, and natural yeast; they coax incredibly complex flavors out of the unassuming rye kernel through different stages of chemical reactions. That inspired me to malt my own rye for breadmaking: pale rye malt, Russian red fermented rye malt (&lt;em>solod&lt;/em>), chocolate rye malt, and even malt syrup, from different varieties of rye (Abruzzi, Gazelle, Hazlet, Ryman, &lt;em>Svedjerug&lt;/em>, Prima, etc). I was absolutely mesmerized by the different flavor profile and intensity each rye malt (and each rye variety) added to the final bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Studying European beer history. European beer styles evolved in tandem with local barley varieties and malt. Particularly in places like Bavaria, &lt;em>Helles&lt;/em> (pale lagers) &amp;ndash; despite being delicately hopped and regularly made with just a single malt &amp;ndash; taste different across breweries, because the malt, which is the whole ballgame, is different. Breweries have access to dozens of different malthouses, each making their pilsner malts slightly differently, from a range of different barley varieties. The same is true &amp;ndash; and even more pronounced &amp;ndash; in the UK, where ale brewers not only know which facility makes their malt, but also have passionate opinions about the barley variety. In cask ales, for example, the differences between different barley varieties and malts are magnified, creating distinct flavors.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>One of the factors that contributed to the development of the brewing industry as a whole was the spread of pale malts. In the Late Middle Ages, England had been struggling with wood shortages and switched to using the cheaper coal. A major problem with coal was that it produces sulfurous fumes during burning, and the flavors imparted to malt dried in coal-fueled kilns &amp;ndash; and subsequently the beer &amp;ndash; were &lt;a href="https://www.beeretseq.com/where-theres-smoke-theres-pale-ale/">not acceptable&lt;/a>. Hence, in &lt;em>ye olden times&lt;/em> malt had to be dried over wood, peat, or straw &amp;ndash; all of which infused malt with the smoky character of the heat source and gave it a brown color &amp;ndash; or the best Welsh anthracite, the supply of which was quite limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1603, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Plat">Sir Hugh Plat&lt;/a> suggested that coal might be charred in a manner analogous to the way charcoal is produced from wood. He heated some coal without burning it, which distilled the coal, removed its offensive sulfurous smell, and left a residue with a high carbon content and few impurities. This was coke, which proved to be a highly useful fuel for heating and industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The coke process remained unnoticed until 1642, when malt makers in Derbyshire began to employ coke for roasting malt. Coke demonstrated superior qualities over other fuels at the time: It generates a great deal of heat without the attendant soot and smoke, and it allows better thermal control. Coke-dried malt was considered an improvement in quality over wood-dried malt, and brought about an &amp;ldquo;alteration which all England admired.&amp;rdquo; Brewers were finally able to mass-produce a lighter roast of the malt that was not &amp;ldquo;smoked.&amp;rdquo; This malt was called &amp;ldquo;pale,&amp;rdquo; and it led to the creation of what by the end of the 17th century was called &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp;quot;&lt;strong>pale ale&lt;/strong>.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> Coke became the &lt;em>crème de la crème&lt;/em> of fuels in England. Coke-fired blast furnaces made the production of inexpensive cast iron possible, which was one of the factors that drove the Industrial Revolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The British Empire was in full sway, with merchants and traders traveling around the world. India was the &amp;ldquo;crown jewel&amp;rdquo; of the empire, hosting a large British military and civilian population with a thirst for beer. The tropical climate in India made local brewing of typical English pale ales impossible. Casks of porters and stouts shipped in from England fared poorly because of the long sea voyage and temperature fluctuations; bottled products produced mixed results as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1790, George Hogeson of the Bow Brewery in London developed a recipe for pale ale that included a huge increase in hops and a much higher alcohol content (both known to have preservative qualities). The export casks were primed with sugar and dry-hopped prior to shipping. The resulting beer arrived in India unspoiled, but much stronger and hoppier than the domestic version. This &amp;ldquo;India Pale Ale&amp;rdquo; (&lt;strong>IPA&lt;/strong>) quickly became hugely popular and profitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pale malt has a huge advantage over darker malts: It contains more enzymes and more fermentable sugars, which allows for more efficient beer production; the taste of the finished beer is much cleaner, as yeasts are able to break down a higher percentage of the chemical compounds dissolved in wort. This fact was likely not explicitly known to brewers until the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrometer#Saccharometer">saccharometer&lt;/a> was invented in the late 18th century. Given that coke was too expensive for commercial brewing back then, pale ales remained mostly exclusive to the households of the wealthy gentry in northern England.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the US, light lager was the focus of domestic breweries until ~2000. The specific needs of breweries for producing this style of beer trumped the beer&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;character&amp;rdquo; development. 2-row malt is good enough; the barley and malt industries became streamlined to efficiently produce this neutral, light-flavored product for the purpose of brewing domestic light lagers. This specialization, however, created a structural problem for craft breweries looking for malt flavors &amp;ndash; worse, it led to a zymurgic myopia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, American breweries don&amp;rsquo;t have nearly the selection of malts that Germans have. Weyermann, a common source, makes a high-quality pilsner malt from 2-row spring barley. Brewers love its strong, distinctive character, which really makes a lager pop. The problem is every lager tastes like Weyermann® pilsner malt, which is why so many breweries in Bavaria use different malthouses to differentiate their beers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Craft brewing has gone through eras of hop enlightenment and yeast consciousness. Not too long ago, brewers were content with a handful of C-hops and some Chico yeast. Now hop breeders release dozens of new hops a year; yeast labs and yeast varieties are mushrooming. Brewers are constantly tinkering with ingredients to produce new flavors, and highly attuned to subtle differences.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I ask my maltsters to include the barley variety mix in their analysis data. Having a malt analysis without varietal data is like describing a dog without knowing the breed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dan Carey, New Glarus Brewing&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It seemed like a watershed moment when we first scratched the surface of &amp;ldquo;biotransformation&amp;rdquo; and, subsequently, the effect of ester-rich yeasts on IPAs. As this style has evolved by leaps and bounds, we have gained a better understanding of how hops interact with different processes &amp;ndash; and with yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How might different base malts affect beers?&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>America does have a number of &lt;a href="https://craftmalting.com/">craft malthouses&lt;/a>. Although many aren&amp;rsquo;t yet able to supply breweries with a reliable source of base malts for a year of regular-production beer, things might change with growing interest that will allow them to increase production and lower prices to compete with mass-produced malts. Some of these craft malts are not only interesting and flavorful, but also benefit the local economy and environment. A world with dozens of small, viable malthouses has the potential to transform beer tremendously, like hops and yeasts did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the single-origin base malts crafted by &lt;a href="https://www.gallatinvalleymalt.com/">Gallatin Valley Malt&lt;/a> (a farmer-owned craft malthouse in Manhattan, Montana) are quite distinct from the same types I&amp;rsquo;ve tried from several other malthouses (including &lt;a href="https://montanacraftmalt.com/">Montana Craft Malt&lt;/a>, which is located only ~1 hour away from Gallatin Valley Malt).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Heather Sargent, Head Maltstress at Gallatin Valley Malt, articulates the variability to me:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Malts will generally vary in flavor and analysis between malt houses for several reasons. Where the barley is grown and how it&amp;rsquo;s grown play a huge part in the quality that the Maltster has to work with. Whether or not the grain is blended is another factor. Dry farming vs. irrigated. The way in which the grain is malted. Therefore, brewers can make their determinations based on the outcomes and what they like.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That means, there are thousands of variations in just the &amp;ldquo;pale malt&amp;rdquo;! And the malt that goes into the recipe matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Breweries' chalkboards and printed menus often boast hop varieties, hoping (often correctly) that words like Citra, Enigma, or Lemondrop will entice customers to order a pint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s rare, literally unheard of, for a brewery to advertise the malt bill on a menu (although it does show up from time to time on labels). The most overlooked ingredient can mean the difference between an enjoyable pint and a drain pour, and even help a brewery stand out and differentiate itself from the pack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In what appears to be a fairly mature industry, craft malts have a chance to inject a new wave of innovation into our glasses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The varieties of the grains that go into the malt are just as important as the hops that go into the wort. And not only the variety, but also the growing region (terroir) affects the malt&amp;rsquo;s flavor, haze, and foam stability.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="saccharified-mash">Saccharified mash&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I limited thiol precursor-loaded, diastatic barley malt to 30% of total grains in the mash; the rest was all adjuncts, as far as diastatic powers and thiol precursors are concerned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The light-golden &lt;a href="https://www.gallatinvalleymalt.com/gallatin-pale">pale malt&lt;/a> by Gallatin Valley Malt, made from Genie barley (grown, harvested, and malted right on GVM&amp;rsquo;s own farm in Montana&amp;rsquo;s breadbasket, the fertile &lt;a href="https://bozemanmagazine.com/articles/2018/09/04/102964-gallatin-agricultural-history">Gallatin Valley&lt;/a>, in a true field-to-kiln fashion), has an endearing aroma of sweet biscuits out of the box. When freshly ground, the malt tastes like Honey Nut Cheerios with a yummy sunflower seed butter drizzle &amp;ndash; none of the grass/straw/hay notes I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed in pale malts from some other malthouses.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I milled the grains into a flour, and mixed everything with water. I intentionally kept the mash thick, because I wanted to create an Italian &lt;em>lievito madre&lt;/em>-style stiff barm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mash then went through&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="barm">Barm&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>People seem to love to hate on the &amp;ldquo;Chico&amp;rdquo; strain. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing the main reason is that it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; strain that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get you &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; flavors like some other yeasts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, Jeremy Myers, head of production for Bachs Biermanufaktur in Saarland, Germany, &lt;a href="https://beerandbrewing.com/cold-healthy-and-crowded-lager-fermentation-simplified/">suggests&lt;/a> using White Labs WLP001 for lagers. He says &amp;ldquo;fermenting cold with that yeast leaves behind a beer with just the kind of clean, crisp flavor we want in a lager.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IMO, &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; strains like WLP001 are clean, versatile, low-ester, and low-phenol. They can be super useful and valuable in the right context. For example, they are &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/wlp001/">terrific for breads&lt;/a> that are intended to highlight a grain&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>terroir&lt;/em>. If you ferment a few doughs with WLP001, keeping everything the same except the flours (use different varieties of wheat, e.g. Joaquin Oro vs. Sonora Blanca vs. Turkey Red), I bet you&amp;rsquo;d taste different flavors and &amp;ldquo;grain-forwardness&amp;rdquo; in each baked product. At least I did. In the &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-1-2/">whole wheat bread&lt;/a> I made with WLP001, the yeast elevated the character of Turkey Red to such a degree that I never thought it was possible (with sourdough or bread yeast), and produced a stunningly pure, robust wheat flavor without the slightest hint of acidity &amp;ndash; it was like eating a box of Triscuit Original or drinking an American wheat beer. Pure, authentic, natural wheatopia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like how the Chico strain drove IPA 2.0 due to its &amp;ldquo;cleanness&amp;rdquo; that emphasizes malt and allows hops to shine through, I think it has the potential to do the same thing for Pizza/Bread 3.0 (especially when coupled with the &amp;ldquo;local grain&amp;rdquo; movement). Clean strains highlight the humble grain and let the grain flavor shine through, much more so than sourdough or bread yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this case, I scooped out 140g of the cooled mash (260g remaining), and added a 50/50 blend of &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/london-tropics/">London Tropics&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/wlp001/">WLP001 California ale yeast&lt;/a>. I intended to temper the thiol levels and let other characteristics stand out, to create a multi-layered, balanced bouquet of tropical aromas/flavors. (ICYMI, London Tropics proved to be an incredibly powerful &amp;ldquo;weapon of mass thiolization&amp;rdquo; in my &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">last experiment&lt;/a>.)&lt;/p>

&lt;td>0.5%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>0.7g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Total: 141.4g&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I added both yeasts at the same time, since they have similar optimal temperature range. I let the barm ferment, loosely covered, at 68-72°F for ~18 hours. The barm doubled in volume by the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">last time&lt;/a>, POG-type tropical aromas started to manifest ~3 hours in, but never got as pungent, which was expected, since the amount of precursors in the mash was drastically reduced and the inoculation rate of thiolized yeast was halved.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="final-dough">Final dough&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This time, I decided to make a batch of &lt;em>bomboloni&lt;/em> (yeasted Italian donuts), instead of a loaf of bread.

&lt;p>No sugar in the dough, because I wanted the sweetness to come from the coating on the outside, which would make the layers complement each other as you bite through them. Heterogeneity and contrast!&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Mix everything together into a stiff dough. (The dough smelt gently sweet and fruity, like a floral forest after rain.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Bulk ferment at ~72°F for 6 hours. Fold once every 30 mins, 4 times in total.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Retard in the fermentation fridge (~45°F) for 12 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Divide into 12 pieces (~62g each), and shape into taut balls.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Proof at ~72°F for ~6 hours until doubled in size.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Heat a pot of coconut oil to 350°F; fry for 5-7 minutes on each side until brown and crispy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Remove from oil and let dry on a wire rack lined with paper towels.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once cool (but still warm), coat in homemade powdered sugar enhanced with a dash of cinnamon.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>These donuts had a super fluffy, airy texture, almost completely concealing the fact they were made from unsifted whole grains. They also had a substantial mouthfeel &amp;ndash; quite contrary to the emptiness I always experience when eating donuts from national donut chains, which tend to be so overloaded with sugar that they melt in your mouth like cotton candy (in a bad way).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tropical aroma was hard to distinguish underneath the cinnamon sugar coating, but a ripe fruit flavor was noticeable in the crumb, alongside an unyielding wheat flavor. It mildly reminded me of Kellogg&amp;rsquo;s Tropical Froot Loops cereal. Definitely not POG bombs this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, I think these thiol-complimentary &lt;em>bomboloni&lt;/em> turned out much more balanced and delectable than my &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-5-1/">last thiol-dominant bake&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; once again, proving &amp;ldquo;more isn&amp;rsquo;t always better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, I don&amp;rsquo;t think the flavor was quite right &amp;ndash; it didn&amp;rsquo;t have the multi-layered bouquet of aromas/flavors I was expecting. Something was still amiss.&lt;/p>

&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>ICYMI, there has been a huge thiols-at-all-cost craze going on in the brewing world. Heavily hopped IPAs with novel tropical fruit aromas and flavors have been a massive growth category. Triple New England IPA has consistently topped Untappd&amp;rsquo;s list of highest-average rated beer styles, and 1/3 of Untappd&amp;rsquo;s 120 million check-ins in 2022 were some kind of IPA. (Which makes one wonder about Heineken&amp;rsquo;s new American debut, Heineken® Silver, brewed specifically to meet &lt;em>Americans' distaste for bitter beers&lt;/em>.)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In 2022, the top three beer styles for the highest number of overall Untappd check-ins were: American IPA, New England IPA and Imperial IPA (the style distinction between an American and a New England IPA is hard to define as almost all of the world’s top 50 highest rated American IPAs are hazy in appearance). &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The IPAs of 2013 were so bright you could read that year’s best-of list through any of the beers. Sparkling and golden-amber in colour, they were simply American IPAs and didn’t need a West Coast prefix to make drinkers realise it’s not a hazy New England beer – the whole prospect of a cloudy yellow IPA was still a curiosity. Viewed from 2023, where almost all IPAs (and Pale Ales) are now at least a bit hazy, and many are totally opaque with a mouthfeel often described with adjectives like smooth, thick and juicy, those original West Coasters feel like a throwback. That clean clarity and crispness of flavour has gone sweet and squidgy, and it’s not just the IPAs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Commercial breweries and home-brewers all over the world are injecting new products (e.g. Thiolized® yeasts and Phantasm® thiol powder), switching to fancy hops (e.g. Vic Secret™, Amarillo®, Mandarina Bavaria, Nelson Sauvin™, and Motueka™) and hop products (e.g. Cryo Hops®, Incognito®, Salvo™, and SubZero Hop Kief™), and trying new techniques (e.g. mash-hopping) to make &amp;ldquo;thiol bombs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The results have been mixed. There are some success stories underneath the hype, but a number of brewers say it&amp;rsquo;s just a cranked-up odd flavor (mostly aroma) that may not even compliment the finished beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Evidently, tinkering with thiols takes a lot of &amp;ldquo;trial and error.&amp;rdquo; The wine industry has been researching and creating thiol-optimized strains since ~2004, nearly 20 years before the beer industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to go down the thiol rabbit and see what it was all about.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="thiology">Thiology&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Over the last several decades, there have been endless studies on the hop plant and the enormous impact hops have had on craft brewing, particularly in America. New hop varieties have been &lt;a href="https://daily.sevenfifty.com/beer-hops-are-going-high-tech/">R&amp;amp;D&amp;rsquo;ed&lt;/a>, specifically focusing on the creation of compounds that humans perceive to impart bold tropical fruit aromas and flavors.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="embed music-spotify">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>American hop varieties are characteristically fruity; they add aromas of citrus, pine, tropical fruit, black currant, sweat, and onion/garlic to beer, thanks to the aromatic compounds that originate in the hops' essential oil, which is comprised predominantly of mono- and sesqui-terpenes (volatile organic compounds that play crucial roles in human perception of table grape and wine flavors), some terpene alcohols, and a tiny bit of sulfur-containing &lt;strong>thiols&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Researchers have found that these biotransformative thiols are the main contributors to the highly sought-after tropical aromas, and thus may be giving certain hop varieties an edge over others. (Biotransformation just means the development of new aromas and flavors when yeast interacts with this &lt;em>smörgåsbord&lt;/em> of compounds.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thiols (also called mercaptans, with the general formula R-SH), are sulfur analogs of alcohols.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three volatile thiol molecules responsible for tropical aromas in beer have been in the spotlight across the winemaking and brewing communities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>3-mercaptohexanol (&lt;strong>3MH&lt;/strong>), which creates citrus aromas like grapefruit and gooseberry;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3-mercaptohexyl acetate (&lt;strong>3MHA&lt;/strong>), which can come across as guava or passion fruit; and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4-mercapto-4-methylpentan-2-one (&lt;strong>4MMP&lt;/strong>), which the nose recognizes as black current or wood aromas.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Instead of smelling sulfury like rotten eggs, these free, volatile thiols have tropical and fruity aromas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see, the first 2 molecules &amp;ndash; 3MH and its acetate ester, 3MHA &amp;ndash; are almost solely responsible for imparting strong tropical fruit aromas.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-5-1/what-are-thiols.png"
alt="An overview of thiols"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>An overview of thiols: structure, aroma profile, and threshold. The small concentrations make a ton of difference in human perceived aromas and flavors.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The thiol content in hops depends strongly on the variety, and can be influenced by harvest maturity, terroir, and other seasonal variables. Several of the most popular hops of the last decade, e.g. Cascade, Citra®, Simcoe®, Nelson Sauvin™, and Mosaic®, are found to contain&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>free thiols&lt;/strong>, which are aroma-active, volatile compounds such as 3MH, 3MHA and 4MMP that are soluble in beer; as well as&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>thiol precursors&lt;/strong>, which are &amp;ldquo;bound&amp;rdquo;, non-aroma-active, non-volatile compounds that can be liberated &amp;ndash; with the help of a specific enzyme &amp;ndash; from the amino acids they are bound to, and thus become free and aromatic.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The presence of these thiol compounds, alongside the complex array of terpenes and other essential oils, seem to give these hop varieties an edge when creating fruit-forward beers such as American IPAs. Some of these hops are running out in places, probably due to this thiol craze (and supply chain disruptions).&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="free thiols in hops"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Published data on free thiols in hops&lt;/p>&lt;p>Source: &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/files/CBC-Development-of-Thiols-and-Thiol-Precursors-in-Different-Hop-Varieties.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Christina Schönberger and Laurent Dagan, Craft Brewers Conference 2020&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Most common thiol precursors, in their conjugated (glutathionylated or cysteinylated, often written as &lt;strong>Glut-3MH&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>Cys-3MH&lt;/strong>) and therefore non-active forms, have been identified in multiple other plant raw materials as well, such as grapes (and musts), tannin, fruits, and malts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many plants naturally produce an odorless molecule (Glut-3MH) as a byproduct of glutathione metabolism. Some of this Glut-3MH is converted into a second, non-volatile molecule, Cys-3MH, through the activity of naturally occurring plant enzymes; then, another plant enzyme converts some of this Cys-3MH into the aroma-active thiol, 3MH.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-5-1/F2_pathway-01.png"
alt="Biosynthesis of 3MH in plants"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Biosynthesis of 3MH in plants (red arrows = enzymatic reactions)&lt;/p>&lt;p>Source: &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/science-lesson/enhance-thiol-biotransformation-with-tropics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Berkeley Yeast&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Pure natural magic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The efficiency of each step in this biosynthetic pathway varies dramatically across different plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In tropical fruits like guava and passion fruit, for example, the conversion of Glut-3MH &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Cys-3MH &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; 3MH is very efficient, and these plants contain a high concentration of 3MH as a result. That&amp;rsquo;s why tropical fruits smell like tropical fruits &amp;ndash; they contain significant sources of volatile thiol compounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In barley malts and hops, however, the efficiency of these two reactions is obviously low (that&amp;rsquo;s why these two naturally don&amp;rsquo;t smell like tropical fruits). The enzymes that catalyze each conversion are inefficient, producing few 3MH molecules. Even in hops that are famous for tropical fruit characters, researchers have found that &amp;lt;=1% of the Glut-3MH is actually converted to 3MH.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consequently, barley malts and hops contain a low concentration of free thiols like 3MH, but high concentrations of thiol precursors like Glut-3MH and Cys-3MH.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>That means, the abundance of thiol precursors found in hops and malts have the potential to be converted into volatile thiols during fermentation &amp;ndash; just think about how exciting it would be to figure out how to unlock it all! This, indeed, has recently become a subject of great interest &amp;ndash; or even obsession &amp;ndash; for brewers. The reason is simple: While these thiol precursor molecules are flavorless, it only takes 1-2 enzymatic reactions to biotransform them into aroma-active 3MH and unleash a tropical fruit nirvana.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of these yeast-encoded enzymes capable of converting flavorless precursor molecules into volatile thiols during &amp;ldquo;biotransformation&amp;rdquo; is &lt;strong>cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyase&lt;/strong> (&lt;strong>CSL&lt;/strong>), from the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. This enzyme can break the carbon-sulfur bond present in these odorless cysteinylated thiol precursors, releasing the highly aroma-active unconjugated form (polyfunctional/free thiols).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A number of companies have created various new products that focus on enhancing thiol biotransformation. There are currently two main approaches, and they often go hand in hand:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>increase the load of thiols in the mash, especially in the bound form (since thiol precursors are abundant in nature and non-volatile);&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>manipulate the enzymes to turbocharge the thiol biosynthesis process.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I will look at some of the most popular products in each category.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thiol-precursor-enhancers">Thiol precursor enhancers&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Outside of thiol precursor-laden hops like Calypso™, Cascade, Mittelfrüh, and Žatec (Saaz), one (overhyped) product that claims to enhance or elevate thiol precursors is Phantasm®, a powder made from New Zealand Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc grapes, which are said to be incredibly rich in both free thiols and Cys-3MH &amp;ndash; allegedly a much higher concentration of thiols than hops and malts.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-5-1/Phantasm-powder.jpg"
alt="Phantasm thiol powder"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Phantasm thiol powder, frequently touted as &amp;lsquo;the biggest modern-day game-changer for hop aroma.&amp;rsquo; Like new iPhones, this product has a super long waiting list and is hard to get.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Phantasm came from the owner of Garage Project, a brewery based in the Aro Valley of Wellington, New Zealand, near the Marlborough region, famous for producing exceptionally high-quality Sauvignon Blancs known for their intense tropical fruit aromas. New Zealand has been ground zero for thiol research as it pertains to the wine industry, with scientists working to better understand how to unlock thiols in Marlborough&amp;rsquo;s expressive Sauvignon Blanc grapes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out that after winemakers use those thiol-laden grape skins, they throw them away.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Maybe one winemaker&amp;rsquo;s trash is another beermaker&amp;rsquo;s treasure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Jos Ruffell, founder of Phantasm and owner of Garage Project&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Ruffell found a way to dehydrate and powderize those leftover Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc grape skins, making a thiol-rich product that brewers could use to enhance the aromas of their beers. A pretty clever business idea.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Ruffell brought Phantasm to market in late 2020, marketing it primarily as an aroma-enhancer in hazy IPAs. Stories of early successes by popular brewing companies, including Ruffell&amp;rsquo;s own Garage Project, went viral on the internet, and created instant, fervent demand that far exceeded supply.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phantasm is an experimental product in extremely short supply out of New Zealand, derived from Sauvignon Blanc grape skins. We&amp;#39;re very honored to be one of the first few breweries in the world, and first in Canada with access to play with this super magical powder.&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Kilter Brewing (@kilterbrewing) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kilterbrewing/status/1371661768838107144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2021&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>Unsurprisingly, Phantasm (both the name of that company and its flagship product) has taken the brewing world by storm. (I wonder how much of a role the scarce availability and perceived exclusivity have played in Phantasm&amp;rsquo;s stratospheric popularity.) Outside of the core four (hops, malt, yeast, and water), Phantasm® is the &amp;ldquo;hottest&amp;rdquo; brewing ingredient on the market today.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Essentially, brewing with Phantasm is like an MSG addition for aroma.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;p>In December 2022, Phantasm (the company) held the inaugural Phantasm Cup, a new (annual) competition to find the best thiol-forward beer in North America, sponsored by Half Acre Brewing and Omega Yeast, in Chicago. The grand prize &amp;ndash; an all-expenses-paid trip to New Zealand during hop harvest &amp;ndash; went to Wise Man Brewing (Winston-Salem, North Carolina), which won for a New Zealand-hopped NEIPA incorporating the theme ingredient.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Other standout Phantasm-enriched beers include a trio of Phuture beers, brewed via 3-way collaboration among three San Diego breweries, each featuring Phantasm® but a different beer style and hop combination:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Pure Project Brewing: Phuture I (New England / Hazy IPA; 6.5% ABV)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Harland Brewing: Phuture II (New England / Hazy Double IPA; 8.0% ABV)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>North Park Beer Co.: Phuture III (New England / Hazy Triple IPA; 10% ABV)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Another California-based collaborative brew from Alvarado Street Brewery and Green Cheek Beer Co., a double-dry-hopped Imperial Hazy IPA with Phantasm®, Nelson Sauvin™, Riwaka™, and Citra®, named Thiology 101, also impressed. Notice the pattern?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, Ruffell continues to capitalize on the worldwide &amp;ldquo;thiol craze&amp;rdquo;, by working on thiol-packed blends of Phantasm® and hops. He&amp;rsquo;s collaborating with Yakima Chief Hops to develop an experimental blend of Phantasm® combined with Citra®, Mosaic® and Simcoe® Cryo hops, and teaming up with Freestyle Hops to create a &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.freestylehops.com/hop-varieties/mega-motueka/">Mega Motueka&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; blend of Phantasm® and Motueka™ hops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Expansion of Phantasm&amp;rsquo;s operation is also on the table. In fact, a liquid version of Phantasm® is in the pipeline, which is shown during trials to be up to 40x as concentrated as the powder, and successful in contributing deepened aromas to finished beers.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Some brewers use Phantasm® powder in tandem with hop varieties that already produce a solid base of thiol precursors, such as Citra® and Nelson Sauvin™, and add a thiolized yeast strain to coax the fullest range of tropical aromatics out of the brew.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We just threw a bunch of shit in the beer and called it good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Phil Humphrey, 608 Brewing Company&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.craftbrewingbusiness.com/news/weldwerks-explains-its-use-of-a-thiol-named-phantasm-and-other-beers-to-know-this-week/">Craft Brewing Business&lt;/a> recently asked Skip Schwartz, Innovation and Wood Cellar Lead at WeldWerks Brewing Co., about what it was like brewing with Phantasm:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Did Phantasm save costs by perhaps requiring less hops than usual to attain an even bigger flavor?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this is our first time using this product, there is still a lot for us to learn and how best to use it. We are planning on trying at least a few more beers using Phantasm before we fully make any decisions. The bigger thing is that it does not change the flavor, just the aroma. Since Phantasm is a thiol, it works more on your orthonasal than it does on your taste buds, but you do notice more defined hop characteristics on your retronasal as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Like I said earlier, tinkering with thiols is a lot of &amp;ldquo;trial and error.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thiolized-yeasts">Thiolized yeasts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Having a glut of thiol precursors alone isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. The true trick is unlocking them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter &amp;ldquo;thiolized&amp;rdquo; yeasts, which are capable of producing CSL during fermentation to free thiols from their precursors, allowing them to have a sensory impact on the end-product.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0740002011000141">IRC7&lt;/a> is the key gene at the center of current research, because it encodes a CSL enzyme. A &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsyr/article/15/5/fov034/2467698">research paper&lt;/a> found that &amp;ldquo;a full-length copy of IRC7 is absolutely required for the cleavage of both precursors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many brewing yeast strains naturally contain the IRC7 gene. However, most of the naturally occurring CSLs in brewing yeasts aren&amp;rsquo;t as active as CSLs from other species, e.g. the CSL of &lt;em>S. hominis&lt;/em>, a natural bacterium commonly found on human skin, is far more active and more specific in generating tropical aromas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ideal yeast strains for thiol biotransformation are those that are capable of &lt;em>both&lt;/em> fermentation and high CSL activity. Unfortunately, this combination is quite rare in the yeast world. Most traditional brewing yeasts have mutations in the IRC7 gene that deactivate the enzyme. Of those that do have a functional IRC7 gene, they are capable of only releasing 3MH from the Cys-3MH precursor, while leaving all of the Glut-3MH untapped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Current methods used to develop new yeasts for efficiently catalyzing thiol biotransformation include&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>interspecifically crossing strains with naturally high IRC7 activity to achieve &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00217-022-04132-6">hybrid vigor&lt;/a>&amp;quot;; and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>genetically modifying existing yeast strains to galvanize higher CSL activity.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>FWIW, lager yeast (&lt;em>Saccharomyces pastorianus&lt;/em>) is a natural hybrid between &lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em> and the newly discovered &lt;em>Saccharomyces eubayanus&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an exciting time for yeast lovers between bio-engineered yeasts and heirloom kveiks.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>A mention of GMO inevitably evokes the popular stigma of Monsanto Roundup Ready®. Indeed, GMO has become a politically charged and highly polarizing topic; GMO foods are widely considered bad and dangerous, so much so that the EU has basically banned GMO crops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like artificial intelligence (AI), genetic modification is a tool, which can be utilized to transform our society, for better or worse. A blanket rejection of all GM products seems silly. Learning more about the history and place of genetic engineering in our society helps to fully understand and perhaps form an informed opinion on this technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em> probably contains ~6,000 genes, and genetically modifying them to produce specific chemicals and pharmaceuticals has &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24677744/">already been done&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In GMO yeasts, researchers essentially delete or add a targeted gene for a specific purpose, e.g. release certain esters, remove certain phenols, or enhance biotransformation potential. Also, a GMO yeast strain doesn&amp;rsquo;t require potentially dangerous pesticides and herbicides, like GMO seeds might. This distinction seems worth pointing out and keeping in mind.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To catalyze efficient conversion of bound thiols to free thiols, the enzymatic activity of CSL needs to be turbocharged during fermentation. So far, there are 2 ways to do that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Activate or turn up the IRC7 gene within the yeast to (over)express CSL.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add exogenous hyperactive CSL.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Both can boost CSL enzyme activity during fermentation to elevated levels, to maximize the thiol biotransformation potential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A handful of thiol-unlocking strains have shown up on the market, specifically developed to enhance the yeast&amp;rsquo;s ability to biotransform compounds found in malt and hops to unleash thiols. The process of making each strain is different, even though the final product is advertised as being comparable, if not the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>White Labs&lt;/strong>, which caught the rising yeast wave and has sold some iconic products for nearly three decades around the world, is a latecomer. It only recently released its first thiol-unlocking product, &lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=267&amp;amp;type=YEAST">WLP077 Tropicale&lt;/a>, which is &lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/news-update-detail?id=74">a non-GMO blend of previously available strains&lt;/a> that are specifically selected for high IRC7 enzyme activity. (I could be wrong, but I doubt this blend will live up to the thiol-releasing potential of the new GMO strains from other labs. This seems like White Labs' way of catching up to the other companies while keeping the non-GMO tag.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Escarpment Labs&lt;/strong> has bred &lt;a href="https://escarpmentlabs.com/products/thiol-libre">Thiol Libre&lt;/a> from strains naturally high in IRC7 activity. (I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that the yeast appears to have lost quite a bit of its English ale character during the hybridization, while also not overexpressing the IRC7 gene that produces the required CSL enzyme to unlock thiols.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Omega Yeast&lt;/strong> has taken the GMO route and used CRISPR-Cas9 to cisgenically insert activated IRC7 gene (OYL-402 Cosmic Punch™), or transgenically add skin bacteria-derived CSL gene (e.g. Helio Gazer™, Star Party™, and Lunar Crush™), to produce Thiolized® versions of its popular yeast strains.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Berkeley Yeast&lt;/strong>, a startup founded by UC Berkeley scientists and funded by NSF, NIH, and USDA, as well as venture capital, has taken the transgenic GMO approach to bio-engineer the &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/available-yeast-strains/">Tropics™ series&lt;/a>, which likely produce the strongest thiol characters of the bunch, because they sourced the &lt;em>TnaA&lt;/em> gene (encoding a tryptophanase with strong CSL activity &amp;ndash; probably the most active CSL known to the natural world so far) from &lt;em>Citrobacter freundii&lt;/em>, a commensal bacterium found in water, soil, food, and the intestines of humans and animals. (&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/yea.1493">Research&lt;/a> has demonstrated that expression in yeast of a bacterial enzyme with CSL activity results in very high levels of thiol production.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It seems yeast companies are drawing a line in the sand and deciding if they&amp;rsquo;re going to be GM or non-GM. The latter opens up the EU market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is yeast going to be the new hops? I think so.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Since I always root for entrepreneurial endeavors, I&amp;rsquo;d like to devote some ink to &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com">Berkeley Yeast&lt;/a>. The 6-year-old startup (based in Oakland, California) has risen out of the ashes of GigaYeast, which ended operations in July 2021. (Berkeley Yeast offers a &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/strains/vermont-tropics/">thiolized version&lt;/a> of GigaYeast Vermont IPA.)&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s first prototype was a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03293-x#auth-Rachel_A_-Li">bio-engineered brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast that makes terpenes&lt;/a> (linalool, geraniol, and citronellol), which produce hop-like citrus and floral flavors &amp;ndash; and make the &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/strains/chico-superbloom/">yeast&lt;/a> a potential drop-in replacement for hops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hops are a key ingredient in beer, and they grow best in just a few places on earth. Most of the US hop crop is grown in Yakima Valley in the state of Washington, which benefits from the Cascade mountains' watershed and sunny, fairly dry climate. Hop production is resource-intensive and increasingly unsustainable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disrupting the hop industry inevitably invites pushback. After all, using hops is part of the tradition of brewing and nobody wants to phase out hops entirely. Complementing hops, on the other hand, and allowing brewers to obtain similar tropical aromas without using those highly-demanded thiol-loaded hops, would be a smarter move.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s precisely how Berkeley Yeast evolved &amp;ndash; from hop-disruptive to hop-complimentary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s main thing, though, seems to be engineering &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/science-lesson/diacetyl-free-strains-prevent-diacetyl-formation/">diacetyl-free strains&lt;/a> that keep diacetyl (a buttery-tasting compound that&amp;rsquo;s undesirable in many types of beer) low during fermentation and after packaging, by inserting a gene that encodes the alpha acetolactate decarboxylase (ALDC) enzyme into the yeast genome. An ordinary yeast naturally converts fermentable sugars into α-acetolactate (precursor to diacetyl) during fermentation. The ALDC enzyme consumes α-acetolactate as it&amp;rsquo;s produced, and converts it into acetoin (the end product of the pathway), thus bypassing diacetyl formation. This ensures beer will stay fresh and clean after it leaves the brewery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They also have a STA1- Sacch Trois, dubbed Alexandre Trois, that &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/science-lesson/diastaticus-and-sta1/">has the STA1 gene deleted&lt;/a>, solving a big headache for breweries. (Middle finger to &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->White Labs &lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=182&amp;amp;type=YEAST&amp;amp;style_type=5">WLP644&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->?)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CRISPR-Cas9 is one way to edit genomes. The technology took a big step forward in the US in 2016 when the Department of Agriculture decided it &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.19754">would not regulate a CRISPR-edited mushroom&lt;/a>, which was engineered to resist browning by targeting a family of genes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Berkeley Yeast started GM trials with CRISPR, but now utilizes a different set of (open source) molecular scissors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to Omega&amp;rsquo;s top-selling Thiolized® series, Berkeley Yeast developed the Tropics™ in a different way, but the purpose is the same: to produce more of the hyperactive enzyme that unlocks thiols.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Based on what I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered so far from research papers, podcasts, and various corners of the internet, my high-level understanding of how Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s Tropics™ strains work is &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s two-fold:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Precursors &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; 3MH: a CSL-encoding gene (&lt;em>TnaA&lt;/em>) is transgenically sourced from a commensal bacterium, &lt;em>Citrobacter freundii&lt;/em>, and inserted into a parent London ale yeast strain to turbocharge the CSL enzyme, which breaks the carbon-sulfur bond in these odorless cysteinylated thiol precursors, releasing non-active thiols into the free, volatile, aromatic form (3MH).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>3MH &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; 3MHA: esters in &lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em> are produced by the alcohol acyltransferase (AAT), another yeast-encoded enzyme. One or more of the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->native AATs&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> expressed in the Tropics™ strains is capable of acetylating 3MH to its acetate ester, 3MHA.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Because human sensory threshold for 3MHA (aromas of guava and passionfruit) is &lt;em>waaaay&lt;/em> lower than for 3MH (citrus aromas like grapefruit and gooseberry), a single molecule of 3MHA is perceived to be as potent as at least a dozen molecules of 3MH. It&amp;rsquo;s the synergy of these two molecules that creates a tropical fruit nirvana. Voila!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The best way to delve into thiols is to actually play with it, through hands-on &amp;ldquo;trial and error.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>TL;DR&lt;/code>: I made a simple wholegrain bread, with 38.5% barley malt flour and 61.5% whole wheat flour. I cooked up a big batch of the mash and split it into two equally. One was inoculated with Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/strains/london-tropics/">&lt;strong>London Tropics&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, the other with &lt;strong>London Tropics &lt;em>and&lt;/em> &lt;a href="https://berkeleyyeast.com/boost/thiol/">Thiol Boost&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. Otherwise, these were exactly the same. (Equivalent of split-batch brewing; one recipe, two beers.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Spoiler&lt;/code>: The breads turned out COMPLETELY different. A tiny drop of Thiol Boost made a ton of difference. One had a crisp, assertive maltiness with a fruity undertone, the other had crazy fruit punch energy like a POG (passion fruit, orange, and guava) bomb.&lt;/p>

All the other undesirable plant molecules, such as 4MMP which may come across as diesely and dank, are stripped away.&lt;/p>

The flavor transports me back to childhood days of eating popsicles on a hot summer day. 1 tiny drop (0.5mL) goes a loooong way.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This is very much like brewing a beer, &lt;em>sans&lt;/em> hops. Instead, it relies on the gluten in wheat flour for structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aroma and flavor produced by London Tropics were very, very noticeable throughout the process and in the baked bread; that one drop of Thiol Boost made a ton of difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The devil, as always, is in the details.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="1-all-barley-malt-mash">1. All-barley malt mash&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Since thiol biotransformation begins with the precursor molecules (Glut-3MH and Cys-3MH), the amount of 3MH and 3MHA produced by thiolized yeast depends on the concentrations of these precursors in the grains used for baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As mentioned earlier, thiol precursors are not just in hops, but also &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/files/143_Dagan.pdf">largely abound in malts&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Researchers' key findings:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Glut-3MH was the most abundant precursor across malts considered.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Roasting appears to considerably reduce the amount of precursors, since no precursors were found in the most roasted malt sample. In other words, un-kilned or lightly kilned malts are shown to contain more precursors than kilned ones.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Malts made from barley are all higher in thiol precursors than non-barley varieties. Barley malts exhibited the highest concentrations of Glut-3MH and Cys-3MH with levels ranging from 40-700 mg/kg and from 1-7 mg/kg, respectively, much higher than malted rice, sorghum or wheat.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>TL;DR, if you want to create an overload of thiol precursors in the mash, stick with un-kilned or lightly-kilned barley malts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I used a 5-step infusion mash to maximize the potential of endogenous enzymes. I did the whole thing on a kitchen stove top so I could easily apply direct heat when needed. It took 8 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Finely grind all the malts into flour. Mix with water. Start at 95°F. Hold at 95-110°F for 30 minutes (acid rest).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Gradually raise the temperature to ~130°F. Hold at 128-133°F for 30 minutes (protein rest; since most of the malts used here are well-modified and already contain higher levels of amino acids, the mash benefits from a protein rest closer to 133°F than 122°F, IMO).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Gradually raise the temperature to ~145°F. Hold at 140-149°F for 4 hours (beta-amylase conversion).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Gradually raise the temperature to ~158°F. Hold at 155-162°F for 2 hours (alpha-amylase conversion).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Gradually raise the temperature to ~168°F. Hold at 168-170°F for 1 hour (dextrin conversion).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>After 8 hours, the mash took on a darker brown color, and tasted incredibly malty and sweet, like a condensed wort. No fruity aroma or flavor whatsoever, as far as I could tell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Total: 580g (to be divided into 2 equal portions)&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="2-thiolized-barms">2. Thiolized barms&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I wanted to make 2 loaves of bread, one with London Tropics and Thiol Boost and the other with only London Tropics, to see how much of a sensory difference the booster would make.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I let the mash cool off to room temperature, and divided it into 2 equal portions, placed in 2 separate containers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s recommended dosage for Thiol Boost is 200-400 mL/BBL of wort, which is 0.17%-0.34% of wort volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I added the liquid yeast to both mashes at the same time, and mixed it in thoroughly. One hour later, I added a drop of Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s liquid Thiol Boost to barm #2.&lt;/p>

&lt;h5 id="-observation-log-">📝 Observation log 📝&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>After ~4 hours&lt;/strong>, tropical aromas started to manifest. Both barms smelled pungently fruity, with subtle differences.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Barm #1 (control) smelled like a pile of overripe guavas, bananas, and pineapples, with slight citrusy notes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Barm #2 (thiol boost+) smelled about the same, but with more sweetness to it that reminded me of persimmons.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The taste of both matched the aroma, too. Sweet and fruity; no off-flavors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>After ~12 hours&lt;/strong>, the aromas evolved a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #1 (control): still smelled like overripe, sugar-laden tropical fruits (pawpaws, guavas, mangoes, bananas, and oranges); intensely sweet and chocolaty; a little boozy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #2 (thiol boost+): the difference from control became more noticeable &amp;ndash; wildly sweeter, fruitier, and boozier. The chocolaty sweet aromas became a lot stronger, almost overwhelming, like Tootsie Rolls next to tropical fruits that were too far gone. All of the aromas from control were present, but 10x amplified. The caramelly sugary and chocolaty aromas became so immensely dominant that the fruity aromas became less pronounced.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The taste matured, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #1 (control): the sweetness deepened, reminiscent of chocolate, caramel, and maybe artificial sweetener, with heavy doses of overripe tropical fruit flavors; a slight bitter aftertaste.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #2 (thiol boost+): 50%-70% sweeter than control; stronger flavors of overripe fruits and alcohol, overpowering the chocolaty sweetness; less bitter aftertaste; didn&amp;rsquo;t taste as pleasant as it smelled anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Still no sign of fermentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>After ~24 hours&lt;/strong>, some tiny bubbles finally started to show up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aromas:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #1 (control): aromas of chocolate and caramel deepened further to smell more like Tootsie Rolls; citrus notes became more pronounced and pleasant (no more nauseatingly overripe fruits), inviting mental images of Tootsie Rolls on top of pineapples; boozy smell was gone.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #2 (thiol boost+): less Tootsie Roll, more &lt;em>fresh&lt;/em> tropical fruits picked at peak ripeness; a little grassy note, evoking mental images of tropical fruit salad atop a freshly mowed lawn.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Taste:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Barm #1 (control): a bit sweeter and a lot fruitier; mildly chocolaty and caramely; tasted like Tootsie Rolls and overripe tropical fruits; still a boozy undertone; the bitter aftertaste mellowed out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Barm #2 (thiol boost+): deeply Tootsie Roll; sweeter, fruitier, and more pleasant than earlier; a boozy undertone, reminiscent of vanilla-infused bourbon; the mild bitter aftertaste moved to the middle, right after the exorbitant sweetness.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It seems biotransformation started (3-4 hours in) waaaay before any signs of fermentation showed up (~24 hours in).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>After ~48 hours&lt;/strong>, both barms were brimming with bubbles and nearly doubled in volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aromas:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #1 (control): about the same, with a clearer emphasis on Tootsie Rolls sweetness.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm #2 (thiol boost+): about the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Taste:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Barm #1 (control): sweeter, fruitier, and much more pleasant; loads of fresh, perfectly ripe guava and pineapple, with a slightly tart finish; the citrus flavor moved to the foreground and became much more pronounced.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Barm #2 (thiol boost+): intensely fruity; a wide range of tropical fruits like pineapple, guava, mango, passion fruit, etc.; a brighter and much more pleasant flavor profile on the palate; a grapefruit-like metallic aftertaste.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I stirred both barms back down, and they came back up almost immediately.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For both doughs, I did&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>autolyse: 30 minutes at ~64°F&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>bulk fermentation: 8 hours at ~70°F&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>final proof: 16 hours at ~64°F&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>bake: 45 minutes in total; 10 minutes @ 400°F and 35 minutes at 350°F.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The pungent tropical fruit aromas persisted into the final dough, carried over to my hands during dough-mixing, and stayed for hours after.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No tropical fragrance during baking, just typical bread crust aroma.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I let the baked breads rest for 12 hours before cutting.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What emerges from the spectral mist?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A wholegrain bread, transmogrified through fermentation by Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s London Tropics, with the addition of Thiol Boost, naturally releasing an aromatic phantasmagoria of ripe tropical fruits.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The aromas from the dough apparently persisted into the baked bread. Very little thermal degradation. Those who say beer yeasts lose their characters in breads are obviously not doing it right. LOL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To me, each bread tasted exactly like how it smelled, from barm to dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A panel of 3 taster (excluding me) donated their palates to this blind taste test. None of them was informed of the ingredients in the bread beforehand, only that it was not gluten-free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had so much fun watching the tasters' reactions. The panel&amp;rsquo;s combined description of these 2 breads:&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="bread-1">Bread #1&lt;/h5>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>aroma: massively sugary and chocolaty, with a fruity undertone, like some kind of fruit candy; one taster mentioned &amp;ldquo;caramel&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Tootsie Roll&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>flavor: mildly sweet; guava, passion fruit, and mango upfront, with a pineapple aftertaste and a little wheaty finish. All 3 tasters pointed out a weird artificial off-flavor, like artificially flavored water.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h5 id="bread-2">Bread #2&lt;/h5>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>aroma: immensely fruitier than bread #1; mainly overripe tropical fruits (ridiculous amounts of guava and passion fruit, with pineapple undertone); subtle chocolaty note (not as pronounced as in bread #1)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>flavor: pungently sickeningly fruity and sweet, like &amp;ldquo;fruit leather rolled in whole wheat.&amp;rdquo; One taster described it as &amp;ldquo;off-putting&amp;rdquo;, one said it was &amp;ldquo;disgusting&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;nearly inedible&amp;rdquo;, and the third one immediately screamed &amp;ldquo;something is wrong with this!&amp;rdquo; and had to spit it out. They all noted artificiality was much more outstanding in this loaf. An overdone POG bomb.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>All 3 tasters were able to tell these 2 breads apart, right away, despite identical crust and crumb textures. They unanimously preferred &lt;strong>bread #1 (the control)&lt;/strong> over bread #2 (thiol boost+), and said bread #1 was much more balanced and more pleasant to eat, comparatively. They enjoyed bread #1 as PB&amp;amp;J, but would not touch bread #2 again.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It was a tremendously fun bread experiment. The flavors from London Tropics are unmistakable. Tropical fruit characters were on steroids in these 2 loaves of thiol-enriched bread, especially in the one with a drop of Thiol Boost added.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tropics + Thiol Boost take fermentation and the end-product to an aroma blast of overripe exotic fruits, beyond realism. It transports you into a kind of infinity feeling. The fermentation goes through several stages, and you end up on a tropical island, touching down via &lt;a href="https://backtothefuture.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Fusion">Mr. Fusion-powered DeLorean time machine&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s tests have shown that Tropics strains are capable of biotransforming unhopped beers. My experiment confirms it can biotransform an &amp;ldquo;unhopped&amp;rdquo; bread (aka. solid beer).&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="thiol-dominant----thiol-complimentary">thiol-dominant &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; thiol-complimentary?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The aromas/flavors that are reported to fade away using Phantasm® remain very heavily in the end-product using Tropics + Thiol Boost. This could be the game-changing combo, instead of Phantasm + Omega.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These thiol-dominant breads turned out a bit too much (there&amp;rsquo;s apparently enough thiol precursors in the malts alone), so I think I&amp;rsquo;ll go light on thiols in the next experiment and make a thiol-complimentary bread, by&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>adding a lot of adjuncts in the mash starter (to decrease precursor load), or&lt;/li>
&lt;li>blending London Tropics with a traditional strain&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>to halve or even quarter thiol levels in the final bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for Thiol Boost, I might have to dip a toothpick in it and swirl the toothpick around in the mash to add just the tiniest hint of the booster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of info on internet homebrewing forums seems to suggest the biggest benefit of thiolized yeasts is that it enhances the aroma experience of a beer more than the flavor. I consider flavor to be a combination of taste and aroma. A more pleasant aroma inevitably leads our brains to interpret the overall flavor as better. Some people say they can&amp;rsquo;t decidedly tell the difference between thiol-boosted beers and those without. Well, I bet they won&amp;rsquo;t fail to notice the difference between these 2 loaves of &amp;ldquo;thiol bombs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="thiols-have-quirks-too">thiols have quirks, too&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Neither the panel of tasters nor I detected any wine-like aromas/flavors at all from Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s London Tropics and Thiol Boost (despite that bread #2 was an overdone POG bomb), but some brewers have reported a weird &lt;strong>white wine-ish character&lt;/strong> in their Phantasm® and Omega Thiolized® brews that detracts from the beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the wine industry figured out thiols way ahead of the beer industry and have already done a staggering amount of research on thiols, some brewers say these thiols are mostly wine-like, wine-adjacent or wine-related flavors &amp;ndash; synonymous with New Zealand-type hops (e.g. Nelson Sauvin™ and Motueka™) or even some new age European hops (i.e. Hallertau Blanc and Mandarina Bavaria). They can be awesome in the proper context, but they&amp;rsquo;re hardly a cheat code or shortcut (although they might save you 20% on hops, which probably nets to nothing per unit dollar spent). When does a beer become a grape ale? Perhaps brewers should step back and bear in mind that there are many more dimensions to a good beer, outside just a juicy burst of tropical aromas.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If you love wine, you&amp;rsquo;re gonna love this beer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Phil Humphrey, 608 Brewing Company&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now that almost every brewer is thiol-conscious, hopping every IPA with New Zealand-style hops or lupulin-enriched hop products, and boosting it with Phantasm powder, how are breweries going to &lt;strong>differentiate&lt;/strong> themselves?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There seems be a ceiling for the thiols&amp;hellip; Once you get there, it&amp;rsquo;s just all the same. Human &lt;strong>sensory threshold gets so saturated&lt;/strong> that stimuli no longer elicit an increased response. More isn&amp;rsquo;t better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of these thiols are produced by precursors found on the ingredients you put in. Some people have reported a &lt;strong>sulfury/diesely character&lt;/strong> in beers made with Phantasm and thiolized yeasts. Since the CSL expression is fairly non-specific (outside of its proclivity for cysteinylated substrates, as it can barely work on glutathionylated precursors), I&amp;rsquo;m guessing all types of bound sulfur-containing molecules are released by thiolized yeast, resulting in a sulfury aroma.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thiols &lt;strong>dissipate rather quickly&lt;/strong> over time, since free thiols are so sensitive to oxygen. I left bread #2 on the kitchen countertop, cut-side down, for ~2 days, and ~80% of the tropical fruit aromas vanished. Free thiols are found to be &lt;a href="https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:157890">almost entirely absent after 1 year&lt;/a> and as quickly as 6 months in some samples, likely due to their &amp;ldquo;high propensity to undergo oxidation, nucleophilic additions or substitutions.&amp;rdquo; Like life, thiols are fleeting. Best enjoy your thiolized brews while fresh.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="how-to-nuke-your-thiols">how to nuke your thiols&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s Tropics strains obviously already express enzymes that convert Glut-3MH to Cys-3MH during fermentation. More isn&amp;rsquo;t better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With these powerful thiolized yeasts,&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>loading additional precursors (especially Cys-3MH) through Phantasm or mash-hopping may be unnecessary (in this case, mash-hopping is likely to produce astringent vegetal off-flavors);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>late addition, or double/triple dry-hopping, with modern fancy hops, is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> a must (&amp;ldquo;hop creep&amp;rdquo; aside, these may even counterproductively reduce the impact of thiols);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>IPAs (double, triple, cold, New England, West Coast, etc.) are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> the only &amp;ldquo;thiol bombs&amp;rdquo; one can make. (I personally think thiols make more sense in simple blondes, &lt;em>witbiers&lt;/em>, and lagers.)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>A tiny amount of hops (as whirlpool additions) goes a long way towards complementing the thiol character &amp;ndash; unless the goal is to pack as many hops as possible into the beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To create unique, great-tasting breads/beers, you need to understand which bio-active compounds are present in the different ingredients you put in, how high their content is, how they affect aromas/flavors in the end-product, and how they change during the fermentation process and storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A while ago, Brülosophy did a &lt;a href="https://brulosophy.com/2023/02/20/exbeeriment-impact-phantasm-powder-has-on-a-hazy-ipa/#more-142752">trial&lt;/a> with thiolized yeast and Phantasm thiol powder, and the results were quintessentially &amp;ldquo;inconclusive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Curiously, tasters in this xBmt were unable to reliably distinguish a Hazy IPA made with Phantasm powder from one made without it when both were fermented with thiolized yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In the trial, the author hopped the living crap out of the beer, which inevitably masks the flavor from the thiols and any benefit that the Phantasm thiol powder may bestow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems to me that guys at Brülosophy often don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the value they are testing. For example, they did a pressure-fermentation test where the pressurized side was done at only 8 psi and transferred into an open keg &amp;ndash; basically nullifying the factors that make pressure-fermentation useful. They also did some direct comparisons of yeasts, using highly hopped beers. Of course, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to tell US-05 from BRY-97 in a triple IPA. And then peeps on the internet just eat their stuff up too much and take it as the gospel truth that yeast choice doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, rather than arrive at the correct conclusion &amp;ndash; one data point suggests that in hoppy ales, the yeast&amp;rsquo;s contribution to the flavor profile can be less perceptible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yeast matters. Just ask the Belgians.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Research on the evolutionary history of STA1 has shown the gene was not present in the wild ancestor of brewing yeast (&lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em>), but rather arose during the course of brewing &amp;ndash; formed by a mutation that fused two ancestral genes &amp;ndash; as an alternative evolutionary strategy for efficient utilization of sugars in brewer&amp;rsquo;s wort. The resulting diastatic strain (&amp;ldquo;STA1+&amp;rdquo;, i.e. &lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. diastaticus&lt;/em>) is able to consume complex sugars like oligosaccharides from dextrins and starches, which has allowed the strain to outcompete its ancestor. The STA1+ strains mainly rely on the Sta1p glucoamylase to break down maltotriose (unlike Ale/Beer 1 strains), which means these STA1+ strains will ferment fast initially when it gorges on glucose and maltose, but slow down as it moves on to consume maltotriose, since it produces low levels of Sta1p (hence the slow finish to the fermentation). &lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=182&amp;amp;type=YEAST&amp;amp;style_type=5">WLP644&lt;/a>, a Belgian strain, was originally thought to be &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> due to its funky character (e.g. low flocculation, tropical fruit esters, ability to form a pellicle, etc), but through DNA sequencing it was later revealed to be &lt;em>Saccharomyces&lt;/em>. Maybe not &lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em>, but genetically it doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong to &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em>. WLP644 is STA1+, but it&amp;rsquo;s among the strains with low diastatic ability, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6719335/">a 1162-bp deletion in the promoter of STA1&lt;/a>. Other closely related strains are the &amp;ldquo;Duvel&amp;rdquo; family (WLP570, WY1388, WB-06), which also tend to be slow fermenters. Diastaticus has been widely deemed a nasty contaminant in the brewing industry; cross-contamination often leads to unexpected over-attenuation, potentially exploding bottles or cans, and even &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2017/12/18/left-hand-brewing-milk-stout-nitro-damages/">lawsuits&lt;/a>.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

Based on how pungent the guava and passion fruit aromas were in my London Tropics-leavened breads, I thought it odd that Tropics would have added ATT since the paper showed that the addition seemed to reduce the total concentrations of 3MH &amp;amp; 3MHA. Additionally, Berkeley Yeast&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230127053700/https://berkeleyyeast.com/available-yeast-strains/">strain catalog webpage&lt;/a> says all Tropics strains produce the CSL; there was no mention of the AAT at all. I was confused, so I reached out to Nick Harris, co-founder of Berkeley Yeast, for clarification. Nick explained to me that &amp;ldquo;the only gene that was inserted during the engineering was the CSL&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the addition of the AAT was into a strain that we have yet to commercialize.&amp;rdquo; Ah huh! So, whatever AATs present in the Tropics are native, not an exogenous addition. As for why Tropics produced more 3MHA, both in absolute and relative terms, than the strains possessing an additional AAT &amp;ndash; well, it still remains a mystery.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I spent a few days in New York City and did some things I had not done before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I took a trip uptown to the &lt;a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/harlem">125th Street Whole Foods&lt;/a>. I went there, because it was a nice change from Lower and Midtown Manhattan. It was an easy trip (right by the 2/3 train), and I liked having reasons to go to Harlem. That Whole Foods is an easy punch line &amp;ndash; widely dubbed &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/harlem-gentrification-whole-foods-vanishing-new-york.html">the ultimate gentrifier&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo; But I feel like people who say that don&amp;rsquo;t actually go there, because it fits in the neighborhood pretty well. And I saw lots of Black Harlemites there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Getting away from middle-class urban spaces was refreshing to me. I enjoyed going out to Flushing, Elmhurst, and Ridgewood. It&amp;rsquo;s a totally different world out there. I went to see some friends who live near Yankee Stadium, and we hit one of the Jamaican spots there. Honestly, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get out of Manhattan much until my second year living in NYC. Then I&amp;rsquo;d start getting off at every stop along the 7 train, discovering all the amazing cuisines I could find there: Asian, African, South American, Persian, Mediterranean, Balkan&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I walked to FieldTrip (a restaurant chain by Chef JJ Johnson that highlights &amp;ldquo;freshly milled, heirloom rice grains&amp;rdquo;) on Malcolm X Boulevard. I got the shrimp bowl (with coconut sticky rice), and a rice crispy treat spiked with dragon fruit juice for dessert. Every cuisine is getting the fast-casual bowl treatment these days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went to the new Harlem location of Charles Pan-Fried Chicken, on Edgecombe Avenue, for Harlem&amp;rsquo;s best remaining soul food. There used to be a little sandwich shop here that had really good cheesesteaks with a special sauce. I think it was run by the Nation of Islam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On my final day, I met up with some friends at BierWax Queens, a hip-hop and vinyl-themed bar in Ridgewood, run by some DJ, and had an imperial stout on draft (Memory &amp;amp; Perception by Finback Brewery in Queens). Lastly, I stopped by Newyorktitlan, a small hole-in-the-wall Mexican brunch spot nestled in the shadow of the M train near Myrtle-Wyckoff in Bushwick, and had &lt;em>chilaquiles&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Why do people live in New York? There is no relationship between them. Except for an inner electricity which results from the simple fact of their being crowded together. A magical sensation of contiguity and attraction for an artificial centrality. This is what makes it a self-attracting universe, which there is no reason to leave. There is no human reason to be here, except for the sheer ecstasy of being crowded together.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Contrary to what most people think, I always associate corn with the East Coast of the United States. I was first introduced to corn tortillas and &lt;em>paste di meliga&lt;/em> (Italian cornmeal shortbread cookies) in New York City, and then grits in South Carolina.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Old English, corn meant &amp;ldquo;grain&amp;rdquo; instead of maize, because the latter was native to America. Brewing farmhouse ale from maize in Europe was an impossibility, simply because maize didn&amp;rsquo;t grow here. In Orkney, ales brewed from grains are referred to as &amp;ldquo;corn ale.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the New World, however, corn = maize. Corn defined drinking and bread culture during America&amp;rsquo;s Colonial Era as well as the years after the Revolutionary War. Pilgrims made &amp;ldquo;thirded bread&amp;rdquo; (or Boston brown bread) with equal quantities of rye, wheat, and corn. Slather some butter, and it was a complete meal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The colony of Connecticut couldn&amp;rsquo;t sustain wheat production, which meant that &amp;ldquo;thirded bread&amp;rdquo; was not a cultural survivor in the Provision State, although it was popular in other New England colonies. Instead, rye &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; injun, a steamed bread made with just rye and cornmeal &amp;ndash; &lt;em>sans&lt;/em> the wheat &amp;ndash; survives in Connecticut to this day. It&amp;rsquo;s famously mentioned in Laura Ingalls Wilder&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Farmer Boy&lt;/em> as part of one of Mother Wilder&amp;rsquo;s delicious meals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many varieties of corn had their origin in the northeastern US. Cultivated into the early years of the 20th century, the varieties disappeared from the region almost overnight. Changing farm practices and the abandonment of the local gristmills led to the demise of New England&amp;rsquo;s traditional corn varieties, even as the same varieties were being cultivated and milled widely around the world, from Spain to Japan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Corn is remarkable among the grains, because it&amp;rsquo;s used as food from the emergence of the flower buds to the time the kernels are mature. Even among the dry, mature kernels, there is a range of colors, textures, and flavors. No other grain provides such culinary elasticity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More than just a kitchen ingredient, the corn plant is an elegant organism. The cornfield itself provides more than just a crop of wholesome kernels.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Once viewed as a gift of the gods, corn has slipped under a cloud, a victim of modernity&amp;rsquo;s prodigal and detached ways. Today few people actively produce corn from seed to harvest, crack the dry corn kernels into small pieces for backyard chickens, grind it for bread, or nixtamalize it for hominy, tamales, tortillas, etc. Furthering that detachment: Over the last century or so, corn has been transformed from a wholegrain dietary staple into an industrial chemistry kit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of the corn produced in the US is turned into alcohol, starch, oil, and numerous chemicals used widely in food processing; the by-products are used to fatten livestock. The kernels are treated with a strong acid and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_wet-milling">wet-milled&lt;/a>, which allows the corn refiner to separate the starches, proteins, fibers, and oils. We consume corn throughout the day in the form of meat, soft drinks, and processed foods, but only rarely as a whole grain. As early as 1954, the corn-refining industry estimated that 50% of Americans' diet was based on corn &amp;ndash; that percentage is probably a lot higher now. Grain corn has been bred and engineered in astounding quantities to provide certain chemical and energy qualities, yet the modern cultivars of the grain are barely suitable as human food. In fact, some genetically modified types of corn are not even approved for human consumption.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I just had a chance to experiment with some non-GMO food-grade grain corns from Derek Rovey, the 3rd-generation owner of &lt;a href="http://www.roveyseed.com/">Rovey Seed Co.&lt;/a>, based in Farmersville, Illinois. Turns out the tortillas I enjoyed in New England a few years ago were made with Rovey&amp;rsquo;s corn; I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it until now.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Rovey&amp;rsquo;s corn kernels are good-sized and thoroughly cleaned; I guess they utilize some of the latest cleaning and sorting technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This variety of blue corn has slightly less protein, less starch, and more sugar than its white and red counterparts. Its deep purple-blue color comes from its rich anthonyacin content, the same health-promoting compound found in dark berries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Blue corn just hits different, and this variety is no exception.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>First, I tossed a handful of the blue corn kernels on a popcorn popper just out of curiosity. I knew that dent corn has softer kernels (higher content of soft starch) than popcorn, and I just wanted to see how the kernels differ when heated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, the blue corn kernels popped more than I expected. They didn&amp;rsquo;t fully explode into a white, fluffy substance like popcorn, but turned out brittle and concussively crunchy like CornNuts® Crunchy Corn Snacks!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These bluish-brown &amp;ldquo;corn nuts&amp;rdquo; had a very interesting tortilla flavor, too. It&amp;rsquo;s like eating a super crunchy taco shell. Maybe thousands of years ago, in these very lands, corn was toasted in hot sand until the kernels popped?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I also made a bread with milled blue corn and WLP008 East Coast ale yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saccharified-corn-porridge">Saccharified corn porridge&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I intended to achieve 2 goals with the corn porridge:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>To heighten the flavor of corn in the final dough; and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To provide some fermentable starch for amylase in the diastatic malt. Amylase breaks down starch (made up of long chains of water-insoluble glucose molecules) into simple sugars (branched but shorter chains of water-soluble glucose), which can be metabolized by the yeast.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>To make corn fermentable, the starch it contains in the endosperm must first be gelatinized (i.e. breaking down the intermolecular bonds of starch molecules).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Grain starch is composed of glucose molecules bound together in chains. These grain starch chains come in two types: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is essentially a straight chain of glucose molecules, not too complicated, but it has the ability to form pretty dense starch granules, particularly in some varieties of corn. Amylopectin has a branched structure of glucose strands and, for many grains, makes up ~75% of the total starch content.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-4/starch-amylose-amylopectin.png"
alt="Different sources of starch"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Different sources of starch, and their respective percentages of amylose and amylopectin.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Source: &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332008553_Starch-based_films_Major_factors_affecting_their_properties" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Thakur et al. (2019)&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Different starches require different temperatures to properly gelatinize. Conveniently, the gelatinization temperature for barley starch is in a similar range to the amylase enzyme activity optimum. However, for corn starch, the gelatinization temperature is significantly higher. Corn starch granules are typically small in size, polyhedral in shape, and have relatively low amylopectin contents. This makes water penetration into the granule difficult at lower temperatures.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="Different starches gelatinize at different temperature"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Different starches gelatinize at different temperatures (°C)&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Therefore, commonly recommended corn starch gelatinization temperature range is 158-176°F for ~30 minutes. Since I want to be certain that gelatinization is complete, the simplest way to do this is to cook the corn in boiling water. After gelatinization is complete, the starch can then be converted to sugar by amylase.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Process:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Mill the whole-kernel blue corn into a fine flour (slightly finer than cornmeal).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Roast the corn flour in a dry skillet on the stovetop until fragrant. This helps to bring out the rich, deep aroma and flavor of corn.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Set the malt aside. Mix roasted corn flour with boiling water, until evenly combined. Simmer on the stovetop over low heat (185-195°F) for 30 minutes, stirring frequently. This will sufficiently gelatinize the corn starch.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Cool down to ~155°F, stir in the malt, and mix well. Cover and hold at 140-150°F for 12 hours. Saccharification takes place in this temperature range, i.e. amylase converts sugar derivatives or complex carbohydrates into simple soluble fermentable sugars.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>After 12 hours, cool off slowly to room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The saccharified roasted corn porridge made from Rovey&amp;rsquo;s blue corn took on a beautiful dark blue color and intoxicating aroma &amp;ndash; reminiscent of fresh tortilla chips and popcorn at the same time! It tasted sweet like unbaked cookies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The recommended temperature range for WLP008 is 68°-73°F. I fermented the barm (semi-aerobically) at 70-73°F for 14 hours. When ripe, the barm became very bubbly and porous, with a faint ethanol aroma.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This true Midwestern bread had a striking natural blue color, an incredibly tender texture, and deeply nutty flavor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Earthy and subtly toasty, with faint ethanol; reminded me of walking through a cornfield.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The crust was thin and firm, but not unyielding; it held up the crumb well. Very easy to bite through and evidently gum-friendly (great for grandparents and kids).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crumb felt springy in between my fingers; not crumbly at all like a &lt;a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/my-favorite-cornbread/">typical cornbread&lt;/a>. The corn added a little firmness to the crumb, but it was still very moist and tender, custardy and creamy. The slices held up well like as bookends in sandwiches.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A mild tortilla chip flavor upfront, quickly developing into a mellow sweetness with a fruity undertone and a little hoppiness, and ending with a mouthwatering sensation. Clean taste and a nice balance between nutty corn flavors and toasty sweetness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I guess switching from West Coast ale yeast to East Coast ale yeast increased the malty sweetness and fruity esters, along with other subtle yeast characteristics.&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>One of my all-time favorite beer styles is &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> (German: &lt;em>Berliner Weiße&lt;/em>), a deliciously tart wheat beer that originated in the region around Berlin, Germany and developed gradually from the 17th to the 20th century. A popular story has it that in 1809, Napoleon and his troops celebrated their Prussian victory with &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em>; the soldiers described the beer as sweet and tart, strong and effervescent, and dubbed it &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp;ldquo;the Champagne of the North.&amp;quot;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> is defined by its mouth-watering sour tang &amp;ndash; slightly less sour than a &lt;em>gueuze&lt;/em>, and not as funky or vinous. A great &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> is complex but straightforward, acidic but infinitely enjoyable. It&amp;rsquo;s malty but dry, crisp, refreshing, and light &amp;ndash; rarely with oakiness, hoppiness, tannins, or acetic flavors.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Whereas &lt;em>weissbier&lt;/em> makes the drinker monosyllabic, reserved, and retiring, the Bavarian brewings open his heart and let loose his tongue.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Henry Vizetelly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The origins of &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> are hazy at best. Along with its sour cousin, Leipziger &lt;em>gose&lt;/em>, the wheat ale hearkens back to a time when brewers in northern Germany lived by their own rules. Literally. The area evaded the Bavarian &amp;ldquo;beer purity&amp;rdquo; laws known as &lt;em>Reinheitsgebot&lt;/em> for centuries, allowing brewers to create funky, sour ales that resemble Belgian styles more than those of the Rhineland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Weisse&lt;/em> in German means &amp;ldquo;wheat&amp;rdquo;, and &lt;em>weissbier&lt;/em> is usually translated into English as &amp;ldquo;wheat beer&amp;rdquo;, which includes a faulty assumption that there is usually a heavy component of wheat in the malt bill. Like the famous &lt;em>witbiers&lt;/em> (&amp;ldquo;white beers&amp;rdquo;) of Belgium, &lt;em>weisse&lt;/em> also means &amp;ldquo;white.&amp;rdquo; That is, &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> is traditionally brewed from air-dried rather than kiln-dried malt.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>There are several competing theories surrounding the development of the style. One theory holds that the French Huguenot refugees, who fled to Berlin in the 17th and early 18th centuries, developed the beer after migrating through Flanders and picking up techniques from brewers of Flanders brown and red ales. There is little hard evidence supporting this theory, although the Landré family, who were prominent &lt;em>weissbier&lt;/em> brewers and had factories at &lt;em>Stralauer Straße&lt;/em> 36/37 and &lt;em>Münzstraße&lt;/em> 3, were French-born Huguenots. But the Landrés didn&amp;rsquo;t come to Berlin until &lt;a href="https://www.hugenottenmuseum-berlin.de/sammlung/objekt-des-monats/jubilaeumskelch-der-weissbierbrauerei-landre-1885">the second half of the 18th century&lt;/a>, and Charles Fréderic Edouard Landré didn&amp;rsquo;t acquire the wheat beer brewery at &lt;em>Stralauer Straße&lt;/em> 36/37, which was founded in 1780, until 1835. It seems rather late, given the brewing of &lt;em>weissbier&lt;/em> in northern Germany predates the 1600s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another theory points to an improvement of a beer called &lt;em>Halberstädter Broihan&lt;/em>, a &lt;em>weissbier&lt;/em> that was first developed by the brewer Cord Broihan in the 16th century and became incredibly popular across northern Germany for several centuries. A Hanover native, Broihan returned to his homeland in 1526 after a stay in Hamburg, and tried to copy the then-popular Hamburg beer, but failed. So he invented a wheat beer that soon became fashionable. Berlin brewers succeeded in further developing the recipe and brewing a wheat beer that tasted better and was more digestible. The &lt;em>Berlinische Weitzenbier&lt;/em> was born; it was praised by the Berlin doctor J. S. Elsholz as early as 1642. It was officially mentioned for the first time in a 1680 document.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Bohemian military leader and statesman Albrecht von Wallenstein reportedly appreciated the white beer. However, during the turmoil of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), wheat was in short supply. The situation in the &lt;em>Mark Brandenburg&lt;/em> was so dire that Wallenstein complained bitterly in a letter to his subordinate Arnim von Boitzenburg, &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;&lt;em>dahero denn nicht weiß, wie den Durst löschen muss, dieweil ich das Gerstenbier nicht trinken kann&lt;/em>&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;so I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to quench my thirst, since I can&amp;rsquo;t drink the barley beer&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>19th-century Berliners no longer had this problem. By the late 18th century, &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> seemed to have emerged as a distinct style of its own, and became available at all times and practically everywhere. &lt;a href="https://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2015/03/berliner-weissbier-breweries-in-1890s.html">Specialty &lt;em>weissbier&lt;/em> breweries&lt;/a> such as Landré on &lt;em>Stralauer Straße&lt;/em>, Breithaupt on &lt;em>Palisadenstraße&lt;/em>, and &lt;a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei%C3%9Fbierbrauerei_Willner">Willner&lt;/a> in Pankow brewed excellent beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the late 1850s to 1870s, however, &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> fell out of favor &amp;ndash; so much so that an English publisher named Henry Vizetelly predicted in 1859, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp;ldquo;Ten years hence and guide-books will describe [&lt;em>weissbier&lt;/em>] with the same reverence as the Colosseum in Rome, or the Palace of the Doges in Venice. Ten years later there will be a case in the Berlin Museum containing the mysterious goblets, representing a &amp;lsquo;white or a half white,&amp;rsquo; and the so-called &amp;lsquo;cool blonde.'&amp;quot;&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A revival did ensue. In 1879, Vizetelly paid homage to the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>kühle blonde&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; in &lt;em>Berlin Under the New Empire&lt;/em>, describing in detail its place in a Berliner&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In front of everyone stood a gigantic tumbler which could have been fitted with ease upon any ordinary head, and which contained a liquid pale and clear as Rhine wine, surmounted by a huge crown of froth not unlike a prize cauliflower. This was the famous &amp;ldquo;weiss,&amp;rdquo; the mere mention of which suffices to send a Berliner into raptures and into the mysteries of which I was about to be initiated. &amp;hellip; [Berlin was] the city where the &lt;em>kühle blonde&lt;/em> is obtained in the greatest perfection and where &lt;em>bier-stuben&lt;/em> offering no other beverage to their frequenters abound. The beer is drunk by preference when it is of a certain age, and in perfection it should be largely impregnated with carbonic acid gas and have acquired a peculiar sharp, dry, and by no means disagreeable flavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The modern &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> developed relatively late, towards the end of the 19th century. Shortly after the turn of the 20th century, &lt;em>weißbier-stuben&lt;/em> (wheat beer bars) mushroomed all over Berlin. At the height of its popularity, &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> was the most popular alcoholic drink in Berlin, with &lt;a href="https://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2015/03/berliner-weissbier-breweries-in-1890s.html">dozens of breweries&lt;/a> producing it.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>History suggests that wheat beers brewed around Berlin were not originally sour (i.e. not any different from those brewed in Hamburg or Nürnberg), but rather light and easy to drink compared to the heavier &lt;em>braunbier&lt;/em> (brown beer). Most of the &lt;em>weissbiers&lt;/em> were about 3% ABV and used a mash of at least 50% wheat. Interestingly, the wort was not boiled and the amount of hops used was minimal. The hops were typically not added in the kettle, but blended into the mash as a separate boiled infusion to increase the mash temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the wort wasn&amp;rsquo;t sterilized, you can easily imagine the enormous diversity of microorganisms that survived into the cooled wort. Thus, it was crucial to start the fermentation as quickly as possible to suppress most of the spoilage microorganisms. Even so, heat-tolerant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) survived and synergistically fermented the worts into beers with a dry and lightly acidic character. This was not true spontaneous fermentation as carried out in &lt;em>lambics&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; yeast was pitched, but carried both yeast and bacteria from previous fermentations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A. F. Zimmermann wrote in &lt;em>Der Bier-Brauer als Meister in seinem Fache&lt;/em> (1842), &amp;ldquo;all wheat beers, especially in the summer, easily turn sour and sometimes even sour during the brewing process.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other microorganisms survived wort production, too; malts have plenty of their own LAB, for instance. Fermentation took place in wood, which is porous and thus difficult to sanitize.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, there are 3 production stages where acidification could have taken place:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>During mashing: if the mash stood too long, especially at room temperatures&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>During fermentation: primarily caused by yeast cross-contaminations&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>During storage: mainly caused by microflora in the storage vessels&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The result was a range of beers with vastly differing levels of acidity. Although acidity was not uncommon in beers of the 17th-18th centuries, the variability of the beer meant that it often failed to meet consumers&amp;rsquo; expectations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both J. G. Krünitz (in &lt;em>Oekonomische Encyklopädie&lt;/em>, published in 1773) and &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Johann Samuel Halle&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> described the brewing process used in the second half of the 18th century, both indicating production was brewery-specific. For example, Halle offered a recipe made with equal parts of barley and wheat malts, while Krünitz provided one with 2/3 wheat and 1/3 barley. Such differences continued until only two breweries made the beer at the beginning of the 21st century &amp;ndash; and until they merged, &lt;em>Berliner Kindl&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Schultheiss&lt;/em> followed very different brewing processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Krünitz also wrote about how some of the distinctive features of the style&amp;rsquo;s brewing methods had already appeared by the 1770s:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A decoction method, in which Berlin brewers pulled off the thinnest portion of a mash from the top, brought it to a boil, and then added hops to the decoction. The remaining wort was never boiled. This was an important technique. LAB is very sensitive to hops and could easily be killed by over-hopping. This is not a problem &amp;ndash; in fact, a blessing &amp;ndash; when brewing most styles. But &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> relies on &lt;em>lactobacilli&lt;/em> to acquire its trademark sour note. Over the years, brewers have used several techniques to get around this problem. To this day, the brewers of &lt;em>Berliner Kindl Weisse&lt;/em> split the wort, leave half raw, and add hops to only the other half.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Some of the wort was drawn off before cooling and pitched with yeast. By the time the rest of the wort had cooled, this yeasted portion would already be fermenting, and pitched into the main body of wort.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Franz Schönfeld pointed out in his 1902 book, &lt;em>Die Herstellung obergähriger Biere&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In the early decades of the 19th century, &lt;em>Berlin Weissbier&lt;/em> brewers regularly refreshed their yeast with fresh &lt;em>Bitterbier&lt;/em> yeast brought in from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottbus">Cottbus&lt;/a>. If they kept re-pitching harvested yeast, their beer would get too sour.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only in the 1830s or 1840s did brewers begin using mixed cultures that could be safely re-pitched without needing to be periodically refreshed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After World War II, the style started to wane again. Even though it&amp;rsquo;s protected under &lt;em>appellation d&amp;rsquo;origine contrôlée&lt;/em> (AOC) within Europe &amp;ndash; no beer produced outside Berlin can carry the name &amp;ndash; &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> no longer enjoys the popularity that it once did in its home city. The Berlin tradition has sadly slipped through the cracks and remained in a very mournful state, hanging on by a thin thread.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The consolidated &lt;em>Berliner-Kindl-Schultheiss-Brauerei&lt;/em> (now part of the massive Radeberger Gruppe), the last brewery in Berlin producing &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em>, and therefore the last brewery on Earth that may use the appellation, does not even feature the historic beer during its brewery tours. The ubiquitous brand it produces, &lt;em>Berliner Kindl Weisse&lt;/em>, has such a sharp, one-dimensional, lactic sourness that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to drink without those colorful sugar syrups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The few commercial breweries that still produce &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> no longer use a yeast/bacterial blend to co-ferment the beer; the bacterial fermentation is conducted separately from the yeast fermentation, and the beer is blended to achieve a pre-defined acidity. Beers produced this way are very pale, slightly hazy, and effervescent, with a light tang. They are refreshing oddities, but show little complexity.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Like any beer style that has been around for more than 5 minutes, &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> has gone through several transformations, adapting to technological, political and social changes along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of my biggest qualms about beers labeled as &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> on the market is that they are often too light and &lt;a href="https://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2017/10/how-sour-was-berliner-weisse.html">not sour enough&lt;/a> for me. I&amp;rsquo;d like to amp up the flavor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These days, everyone tells you that &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> is brewed with 50% wheat malt and 50% pilsener malt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the beginning, Berlin&amp;rsquo;s brewers sought to keep the beer as white as possible, and used air-dried or lightly kilned wheat. The grist varied throughout history:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Benedikt Koch has an interesting &lt;a href="https://wilder-wald.com/2017/12/08/historic-berliner-weisse-homebrew-recipe/">recipe&lt;/a> for a historically accurate version; it uses 70% wheat malt and 30% pilsner malt to create &amp;ldquo;enough mouthfeel and doughiness from the wheat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My focus wasn&amp;rsquo;t on historic accuracy, but on how to play yeasts, bacteria, and grains off each other to create a balanced, tasty bread that has a similar flavor profile to &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Breweries are split between their methods in souring &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em>. On one side, there are kettle-soured proponents; on the other, you have the staunch traditionalists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kettle souring allows for a quick turn-around and eliminates a brewery&amp;rsquo;s concern for cross-contamination. Souring bacteria need a special cleaning procedure, so some brewers prefer the kettle sour technique to lower this risk. Most American breweries use this technique for brewing &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em>, because it&amp;rsquo;s fast, simple, and consistent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The traditional brewing method is to co-ferment with &lt;em>lactobacilli&lt;/em> and yeast to make a more expressive flavor profile. This takes longer and requires dedicated sour beer fermenters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do what works for me in my home lab. And I&amp;rsquo;m going to combine the method that Krünitz mentioned in his 1773 book with Otto Francke&amp;rsquo;s method of souring patented in 1908.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Important Question for Breweries which produce Acid Beers of the Type of Berlin &amp;ldquo;Weiss&amp;rdquo; Beer. O. Francke (&lt;em>Wochensch. Brau.&lt;/em>, 1907, 24, 621-624). — &amp;ldquo;Weiss&amp;rdquo; beer is prepared by fermenting wort with yeast and lactic acid bacteria. It is a very difficult matter, however, to acclimatise a mixture of lactic acid bacteria and pure yeast in constant proportions. The author recommends a process (which has been employed for two years with very satisfactory results) in which the lactic acid and yeast fermentations are carried out separately. The wort, as it runs off from the spent grains, is subjected to the action of pure culture lactic acid bacteria until the required degree of acidity is attained. The wort is then boiled, cooled, and fermented with pure culture yeast. The beer thus prepared has a pleasant acid taste, and does not require the aid of certain non-slime forming pediococci (see this Journal, 1907, 13, 626-630) to impart a pleasant flavour to it. If a mature, vinous &amp;ldquo;Weiss&amp;rdquo; beer is required, it is only necessary to treat the lactic acid-containing wort with ordinary bacteria-containing &amp;ldquo;Weiss&amp;rdquo; beer yeast. The presence of the lactic acid protects the fermenting wort against the attack of dangerous pediococci, and the beer acquires a sound, vinous taste. The beer prepared by the first method (i.e., that in which the lactic acid fermentation is followed by a pure yeast fermentation) only requires a short period of storage before it is ready for consumption. For the lactic acidification, the author employs distillery culture lactic acid bacillus &lt;em>Delbrücki&lt;/em>, and for the alcoholic fermentation, top-fermentation pure yeast, Race B (high attenuating).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;p>I drew off 80g of the scald and inoculated with yeast (see &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-3/#barm-kveiks-8h--100-95f">barm&lt;/a>), while souring the rest 400g.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>I could let the scald ferment spontaneously over the course of a few days to develop a harmony of lactic acid, like Berliners did a few hundred years ago. But I opted to lacto-ferment the scald with a thermophilic culture, e.g. &lt;em>Lactobacillus delbrückii subsp. bulgaricus&lt;/em>, to build a particular aroma and tart-sweet taste. I have a homemade thermophilic starter (containing multiple wild &lt;em>Lactobacillus&lt;/em> strains) that easily achieves this goal, or I can take a shortcut by using a Bulgarian yogurt that contains &amp;ldquo;live and active cultures.&amp;rdquo; (IIRC, the &lt;a href="https://www.poilane.com/en/products/poilane-the-secrets-of-the-world-famous-bread-bakery-par-apollonia-poilane">&lt;em>Poilâne&lt;/em>&lt;/a> book has a recipe for a 2-day levain that uses yogurt.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time, I wanted to try acidifying the scald with a strain of &lt;em>Lactobacillus brevis&lt;/em> from &lt;a href="https://www.imperialyeast.com/organic-yeast-strains/yeast-types/wild-sour/lacto-brevis/">Imperial Yeast&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Lacto Brevis is a great strain for souring wort in the kettle or fermenter, prior to adding yeast for fermentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I recall reading somewhere that &lt;em>Lactobacillus brevis&lt;/em> typically produces more lactic acid than strains like &lt;em>Lactobacillus delbrückii&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thermophilic cultures love and thrive off heat. Unless you plan to ferment outdoors in the thick of summer in Arizona, you generally need some setup (yogurt maker or crockpot) to keep the heat consistent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other LAB strains you could consider, instead of &lt;em>Lactobacillus brevis&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Lactobacillus delbrückii&lt;/em>: The species name &lt;em>delbrückii&lt;/em> came from Max Delbrück, a Berlin native and a founder of microbiology, who characterized bacteria in the sour beers of Berlin in the 1930s.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Lactobacillus helveticus&lt;/em>: a primary culture used in the manufacturing of hard and extra-hard Italian and Swiss cheeses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Lactobacillus acidophilus&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Lactobacillus lactis&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Lactobacillus plantarum&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Lactobacillus paracasei&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Pediococcus pentosaceus&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Regardless of which strain you use, any of them, to an extent, has a positive effect on the aroma and taste of the bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I added 9.6g of &lt;a href="https://www.imperialyeast.com/organic-yeast-strains/yeast-types/wild-sour/lacto-brevis/">Lacto Brevis&lt;/a> to the scald as an inoculation medium, and mixed it in evenly. Then I covered the mixture with a plastic wrap, pressing down to remove as much oxygen as possible. Keep in mind that liquid yeast cultures from different labs have different concentrations; adjust inoculation percentage accordingly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I typically hold the thermophilic stage at 110-120°F, but Imperial Yeast recommends a temperature range of 100-85°F for Lacto Brevis (&lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/news-update-detail?id=45&amp;amp;type=NEWS">White Labs&lt;/a> has also shown that &lt;em>Lactobacillus brevis&lt;/em> struggles with lactic acid production at &amp;gt;107°F), so I left the scald to sour for 24 hours at 100-95°F.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After 24 hours, the scald showed little activity, which is probably a good sign. Pure cultures of &lt;em>Lactobacillus&lt;/em> &lt;a href="https://www.milkthefunk.com/wiki/Lactobacillus">cannot fully ferment wort&lt;/a>. If it starts bubbling and producing CO₂ visibly, then it&amp;rsquo;s likely cross-contaminated with yeast. Thomas Hübbe, in his 2016 master thesis &amp;ldquo;effect of mixed cultures on microbiological development in &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;, supports that &lt;em>Lactobacillus&lt;/em> attenuates &amp;lt;10% of the sugars in wort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The scald smelled neutral (no funky, phenolic aroma), and tasted mildly tart and sweet. I thought that was a sweet spot &amp;ndash; I didn&amp;rsquo;t want the thermophilic souring to go too far or have a very low pH that could disrupt the yeast&amp;rsquo;s fermentation. The scald will develop its maximal character later from other cultures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Total: 408g&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="barm-kveiks-8h--100-95f">Barm: Kveiks (8h @ 100-95°F)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>About 2/3 of the way through the thermophilic sour, I made a barm with a blend of kveik ale yeasts.&lt;/p>

&lt;td>0.5%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>0.4g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>I used Imperial Yeast&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.imperialyeast.com/organic-yeast-strains/yeast-types/ale/kveiking/">A44 Kveiking&lt;/a>, a blend of 3 kveik strains that &amp;ldquo;thrives in hot fermentations when big complex ester profiles are desired&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;can produce an insane amount of pineapple, guava and other exotic tropical fruit aromas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typically, one would use a neutral German or European ale yeast to ferment a &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em>, so the resulting flavors won&amp;rsquo;t contradict each other. But this Kveiking&amp;rsquo;s ester profile happens to match the tropical tart sweetness of Root Shoot&amp;rsquo;s honey malt. It would be really nice if the former could accentuate the latter.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Kveiking blend also works well when fermenting kettle soured worts for a strong tropical fruit character.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>As with other kveiks, a little bit goes a long way. A low pitch rate (e.g. on the dangerous edge of underpitching), coupled with a continuously high fermentation temperature, can drive these aromatics even higher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kveiking has an attenuation rate of 75-85% and low flocculation. Imperial Yeast recommends a temperature range of 97-75°F for Kveiking. So I mixed in 0.4g of the liquid yeast (adjust the inoculation percentage accordingly based on concentration), gave it a vigorous mix, and let the barm ferment at 100-95°F (same temperatures as Lacto Brevis) for 8 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The barm already doubled in volume after 6 hours. The surface was very bubbly. I stirred it back down, and let it ripen for another 2 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When fully ripe, the barm smelled faintly beery and mildly alcoholic, with some fruity notes. It tasted explosively flavorful, like a pineapple-based tropical fruit punch infused with guava, persimmon, and cinnamon apple!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe the intrigue of &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> comes from what the yeast does in an acidic environment: It comes up with some fun cider, &lt;em>sauvignon blanc&lt;/em>, passion fruit, funky tropical-ness &amp;ndash; which makes this style &lt;em>uber&lt;/em> interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Total: 80.4g&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="mesophilic-sour-3h--95-85f-3h--85-75f">Mesophilic sour (3h @ 95-85°F, 3h @ 85-75°F)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once the barm and the thermophilic sour were both done with their respective fermentation, I proceeded to the mesophilic phase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 1&lt;/strong>: 3h @ 95-85°F&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I dropped 40% (32g) of the ripened barm to the surface of the thermophilic sour, did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> mix at all, and just left it to open-ferment at falling temperatures from 95°F to 85°F for 3 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this temperature range, &lt;em>Lactobacillus brevis&lt;/em> continues to work, acidifying the scald further. The barm begins yeast fermentation of the soured scald.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After 2 hours, I began to notice some very active bubbling (CO₂) on the surface where the barm was dropped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 2&lt;/strong>: 3h @ 85-75°F&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After 3 hours, I added the remainder of the barm, gave it a thorough mix, and left it to open-ferment at 85-75°F for another 3 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this temperature range, yeast fermentation continues. &lt;em>Lactobacillus brevis&lt;/em> should show reduced activity or even become dormant in this temperature range.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Total: 488.4g&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was not until the second half of the 20th century that brewing scientists identified &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> in &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em>. F. J. Methner&amp;rsquo;s 1987 thesis on &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> showed that the mixed pitching cultures contained &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> and a second variety passed on through brewery equipment. The slow-acting strains affected flavor and aroma only in bottles that were cellared for a long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the last few years, a number of people (e.g. &lt;a href="https://escarpmentlabs.com/en-us/blogs/resources/tales-from-the-lab">Richard Preiss&lt;/a> of Escarpment Labs) have isolated &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> strains out of old bottles and even kept some of them alive. Brewing with &lt;a href="https://schneeeule.berlin/en/portfolio/marlene-en/">historical strains&lt;/a> must be fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Funk and &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em>-derived flavors are not required in modern &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em>. Since I&amp;rsquo;m a hopeless fan of funk, I had to seek out some &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> and added a little bit during the tertiary fermentation to accentuate the bread&amp;rsquo;s complexity. IMO, the main function of &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> in &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> is to transform lactic and acetic acid to ethyl lactate and ethyl acetate.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Keep in mind, though, too much &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> can throw a &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> off balance, and detract from its inherent thirst-quenching character. Great funky beers/breads are balanced and fresh-tasting.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>I added 5g (about 1% of total scald weight thus far) of Imperial Yeast&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.imperialyeast.com/organic-yeast-strains/yeast-types/wild-sour/suburban-brett/">Suburban Brett&lt;/a> to the finished mesophilic sour. This &lt;em>Brettanomyces bruxellensis&lt;/em> strain is said to produce &amp;ldquo;complex and balanced aromas of sour cherry, dried fruit and balanced by a unique tropical fruit profile.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to &lt;a href="https://www.milkthefunk.com/wiki/Brettanomyces">Milk The Funk wiki page on Brettanomyces&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If pitched into a beer that has already been fermented by &lt;em>Saccharomyces&lt;/em> or if co-pitched with &lt;em>Saccharomyces&lt;/em>, a wider range of flavors including the funkier flavors can be produced by changing some of the flavor compounds produced during the &lt;em>Saccharomyces&lt;/em> fermentation into other flavor compounds, although &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> can also produce funky phenols on its own (&lt;em>de novo&lt;/em>) without phenolic precursors produced from &lt;em>Saccharomyces&lt;/em>. A small cell count of &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> is plenty for creating these flavors if pitched after and co-pitched with &lt;em>Saccharomyces&lt;/em>, and normally a starter is not necessary unless pitching &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> as the primary fermenter.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Imperial Yeast recommends a temperature range of 74-64°F for this &lt;em>Brettanomyces bruxellensis&lt;/em> strain, so I let it ferment (loosely covered) at 70-60°F for 24 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At these cooler temperatures, kveiks slow down and sit quietly in the background (e.g. lower attenuation and less fruity esters), while &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> shines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When done, the mash became incredibly lively. It had an intensely fruity aroma and flavor that reminded me of pineapple, guava, passion fruit, tamarind, and even the Swedish mesophilic yogurt, &lt;em>filmjölk&lt;/em>! Not one-dimensionally sour, but deeply tropical with a complex sweet tartness. Unbelievably tasty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> certainly contributed a different touch of tartness than &lt;em>Lactobacillus brevis&lt;/em>; they complemented each other well in this barm. &lt;em>Brettanomyces&lt;/em> can be funky / fruity and tart, but not sour.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I prefer my bread to have just a hint of natural sweetness, rather than plenty sweet. Add malt syrup or honey, if desired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I basically mixed everything together into a smooth, cohesive, and soft dough (adjust hydration as necessary). I let it sit at room temperature (~68°F) for 20 minutes to autolyze, before giving it a few rounds of stretching and folding. The gluten was somewhat weak, but it&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I fermented the dough at room temperature (~68°F) for 90 minutes. It expanded by ~50% and felt very puffy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I degassed the dough and shaped it into a log (form into a &lt;em>boule&lt;/em> or &lt;em>bâtard&lt;/em> if desired), and placed it in a 9&amp;quot; x 4&amp;quot; loaf pan for final proof.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After another 90 minutes at ~68°F, the dough rose by ~50% and formed a domed surface with a few cracks. I sprayed the dough with water and baked it for 45 minutes in my ghetto toaster oven (first 15 minutes at 375°F; then 30 minutes at 325°F).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After baking, I let the bread cool off and cure for 12 hours before cutting.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Who knew a surprise was awaiting me when I sliced into this bread?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>aroma&lt;/strong> was very interesting and inviting, like a zesty Granny Smith apple with a hint of raisin and cinnamon.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>color&lt;/strong> of the crumb was somewhere between soft yellow orange and luscious grapefruit (probably due to the bran and germ in unsifted whole red wheat flour).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>texture&lt;/strong> was comparable to that of my regular sourdough breads. The crust was very thin and crisp; the crumb tight and soft. Mouth-filling, biscuity, and wheaty. Not ethereally fluffy, but still light on the palate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>flavor&lt;/strong> was mellow yet deeply layered. It started off with a delicate apple pie; continued to a medley of fruits (banana, orange, raisins, cinnamon apple, strawberries, apricot, peach, lychee, passion fruit&amp;hellip;) that somehow reminded me of banana nut muffins or blueberry streusel cakes; and then transitioned perfectly to a mild wheat sweetness with a little slightly clove-ish undertone.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The finish was mildly tangy (reminiscent of pineapple), and a little &amp;ldquo;dry&amp;rdquo; after I swallowed. There was a wheaty aftertaste. The touch of smooth, rounded acidity left my mouth watering and wanting another bite. Whole wheat seemed to have played off the tartness that defines &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was subtly tart and well balanced, not unduly sour or puckering. You can tell the nice balance of lactic acid in this bread by its lack of sharp bitterness or a salty-type quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wheat-forward, apple-esque, and unexpectedly nuanced.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Like a &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> that&amp;rsquo;s light, zippy, zingy, and drinkable, this bread was very pleasant to eat on its own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A little sweet, a little sour, and a whole lot of complex fruity notes. It&amp;rsquo;s the perfect buddy to soak in that summer social sun with. I&amp;rsquo;m amazed by the harmonious balance of sweetness and acidity, the marvelous self-conducted symphony by different yeasts and bacteria.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The slices paired exquisitely with raspberry jam and goat cheese for breakfast; with leftover Easter ham (or a hot bratwurst) and some sauerkraut for lunch/dinner.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When toasted, this bread took on a slightly different flavor profile: more subtle, less cinnamony, more fruity. It smelled more like freeze-dried apple slices, fruit punch, and Jolly Rancher; and tasted more like field-fresh apples.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One things for sure &amp;ndash; this bread was too easy to enjoy. The whole loaf disappeared in record time (I invited 4 tasters, each of whom gobbled up a few slices; nobody believed this bread had no fruit in it). Simple and elegant, delicious and refreshing. I can see how the mystique of &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> has defied convention and beguiled invaders and imbibers for centuries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would think this bread tastes best 24 hours after baking.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have learned a lot more about yeasts through this experiment. Yeast is going to be the new hops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once again, it&amp;rsquo;s crazy to think that a bread with such complex flavors was made from just some humble grains, without any modern high-tech add-ins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I should have doubled the recipe and made more than 1 loaf. This is a bread I will definitely make again (it was so worth it, and I could easily adapt the timing to my own WFH schedule). I may even top-crop some cultures from the barm for future batches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fruity sweetness&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 19th century, Germans started to find &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> a little too tart and added sweeteners to soften its acidity. Originally, they added &lt;em>kümmel&lt;/em> (a caraway-based liqueur), but today it&amp;rsquo;s common to add a shot of &lt;em>schuss&lt;/em>, or syrup, directly to the glass before it&amp;rsquo;s filled with beer. In Berlin, when you order a &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em>, the waiter will often ask, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>rot oder grün&lt;/em>?&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;red or green?&amp;quot;)&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The colors refer to the type of syrup you&amp;rsquo;d like to add to the beer. Red is usually a sweet raspberry syrup known as &lt;em>himbeersirup&lt;/em>. Green is a more traditional grassy herbal syrup made from &lt;em>waldmeister&lt;/em> (woodruff).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>While Germans commonly add syrups to their &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> to balance its funky sourness, Americans put their own twists on the style by adding different combinations of fruits. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this bread needed any extra fruitiness (it&amp;rsquo;s not a fruit juice), but I may experiment with adding ~10% of wild pawpaw purée in a future iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Lactobacillus brevis&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to &lt;a href="https://wilder-wald.com/2017/12/08/historic-berliner-weisse-homebrew-recipe/">Benedikt Koch&amp;rsquo;s research&lt;/a>, the main &lt;em>Lactobacillus&lt;/em> strain found in &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em> was &lt;em>Lactobacillus brevis&lt;/em>. I did not know this at all before making this bread. I used Lacto Brevis because that was what I had on hand at the moment, other than my homemade thermophilic starter. Other hop-tolerant &lt;em>Lactobacillus&lt;/em> strains, such as &lt;em>L. lindnerii&lt;/em>, &lt;em>L. casei&lt;/em>, &lt;em>L. coryniformis&lt;/em> and &lt;em>L. plantarum&lt;/em>, have also been found in &lt;em>Berliner Weisse&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found a wealth of information on &lt;em>Lactobacillus brevis&lt;/em> in a 2003 paper called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14623377/">beer spoilage bacteria and hop resistance&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, I read that a &amp;ldquo;symbiosis&amp;rdquo; between yeast and &lt;em>Lactobacillus&lt;/em> only seems to work when the &lt;em>Lactobacillus&lt;/em> is &lt;em>L. brevis&lt;/em>. This rod-shaped &lt;em>Lactobacillus&lt;/em> strain seems to leave the simpler sugars to the yeast, which keeps the yeast somewhat fitter in a hostile, acidic environment. There is little information on how this works in beer literature. In sourdough literature, however, it&amp;rsquo;s mentioned and researched several times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Malts and thiols&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How much of the bread&amp;rsquo;s bright, tropical-fruit aromas and flavors are contributed by malts and yeasts, respectively?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, hops high in bound thiols (e.g. Saaz and Calypso) and genetically-modified &amp;ldquo;thiolized&amp;rdquo; yeasts are the go-to tools that brewers are employing to maximally unleash previously inaccessible tropical aromas into their beers. However, a few scientists and brewers are &lt;a href="https://brewingindustryguide.com/what-malt-can-do-for-your-thiols/">discovering&lt;/a> malts may be the most powerful player in this realm.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Lithuania has a best-kept secret: &lt;em>&lt;strong>keptinis alus&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>, an exotic farmhouse raw ale made with &amp;ldquo;baked&amp;rdquo; mash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This beer style &amp;ndash; like a softer, rounder porter but with stronger, deeper caramel and toffee flavors &amp;ndash; dates back to the Viking era. Nowadays it&amp;rsquo;s made by only a few farmhouse brewers in northeastern Lithuania and 3 commercial breweries: &lt;a href="https://dundulis.lt/en/">Dundulis&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.ratebeer.com/brewers/ramuno-cizo-alaus-darykla/10373/">Ramunas Čižas&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.ratebeer.com/brewers/kupiskio-alus/12065/">Kupiškio Alus&lt;/a> (&lt;em>kupiškėnų keptinis&lt;/em> was once voted the best Lithuanian beer on RateBeer.com).&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The brewing process, which has been passed down orally from generation to generation over the centuries, usually begins with a conventional, but thick, mash for an hour. Meanwhile, the brewer heats an oven to incredibly high temperatures &amp;ndash; likely &amp;gt;700˚F (371˚C). Then the brewer packs the mash into tins that look like bread pans and bake them in the oven. Just before the loaves go in, the brewer removes the fuel from the oven, so that it cools over the course of a few hours. While in the oven, the mash forms a centimeter-thick, deep-brown crust, and goes through Maillard reactions in addition to caramelization. Beneath that crust, the firm mash becomes, in &lt;a href="https://www.garshol.priv.no/blog/394.html">Lars Garshol&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s words,&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;sweet, toasted, and caramelly sugary, with earthy, honey-like notes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Imagine sweet mash cookies&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The brewer breaks up the charred mash and creates a second mash, adding hop tea (it&amp;rsquo;s a raw ale, after all) before fermenting. The boatload of toasted sugars imparts massive toasty toffee flavors. I can only imagine the depth of flavors in an old-fashioned &lt;em>keptinis&lt;/em>, as well as its robust notes of caramel and toffee that probably linger for a long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lars Garshol also mentioned that Martin Warren of the Poppyland Brewery in Norfolk, England &lt;a href="https://poppylandbrewer.blogspot.com/2015/04/a-great-way-to-lose-day.html">tried to brew a &lt;em>keptinis&lt;/em>&lt;/a> and failed miserably. Here&amp;rsquo;s what Warren did:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The dry malt bill was mixed in a large bucket until even. Then 1.5kg at a time were put into a large mixing bowl and about 1.4 litres of near boiling water added, enough to wet all the grains and make a stiff mix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was quickly put into a shallow baking tray to form a flat &amp;lsquo;loaf&amp;rsquo; and turned out onto a newspaper.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m guessing the reasons he wound up with black, unfermentable water with no sugar in it are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>the mash was too dry;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>the mashing process didn&amp;rsquo;t last long enough to activate the enzymes that convert starches into fermentable sugars; all the enzymes in the malt were destroyed via baking before any conversion took place.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Of course, you&amp;rsquo;d end up with a sugarless water this way.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>When Lithuanians brew &lt;em>keptinis&lt;/em>, they mix the grist and water into a thick porridge-like consistency, and leave it for an hour to convert. After that, they scoop the mash out and caramelize it in the oven.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Technically, caramelization is the thermal degradation of sugars which leads to the formation of both volatiles (caramel aroma) and brown-colored products (caramel colors). It is similar to Maillard reactions in that it is a non-enzymatic browning reaction, but caramelization occurs by pyrolysis (thermochemical degradation in the absence of oxygen) instead of by chemical reaction. Caramelization is catalyzed by an acid or a base, and generally requires temperatures above 120°C and a pH between 3 and 9.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Baking 30% of the mash probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t give enough flavor to &lt;em>keptinis&lt;/em>. A few years ago, Lithuanian brewery Dundulis made a new effort to &lt;a href="https://dundulis.lt/en/keptinis-baked-ale/">reconstruct traditional &lt;em>keptinis&lt;/em>&lt;/a> that had ~55% of the mash baked, which gave more of the right &lt;em>keptinis&lt;/em> flavor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Curiously, I remember reading about an Iberian beer called &lt;em>caelia&lt;/em> brewed during Roman times with wheat germ that was also formed into loaves and baked. Some sources suggest the bread was heated at very low temperatures and removed while it was still wet; essentially the brewers were creating a yeast bomb to inoculate fermentable grains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During an episode of Milk the Funk podcast, Lars Garshol made the point that historically a large metal kettle for brewing would have been prohibitively expensive for most people, so either adding hot stones to a mash vessel or baking the entire mash was a more affordable option. (This is probably true for most of Europe, at least at one point in time.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, here&amp;rsquo;s my translation of &lt;em>keptinis&lt;/em> into a loaf of bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saccharified-scald">Saccharified scald&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Malt is &lt;a href="https://exarc.net/issue-2021-2/at/ancient-magic-malt-making">ancient magic&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yeast can&amp;rsquo;t live on sugar alone. It also needs nutrients like nitrogen, amino acids, minerals (Zn, Mg, Ca), and vitamins to thrive and grow. The primary source for these building blocks is the free amino nitrogen (FAN) and lipids from malted barley. Refined sugars don&amp;rsquo;t contain any of these nutrients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wort is the liquid extracted from the mashing process during the brewing of beer or whisky. Wort contains the sugars (especially maltose and maltotriose) that will be fermented by the brewing yeast to produce alcohol. An all-malt wort contains all the nutrients yeast needs for fermentation, except oxygen and zinc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lab studies have shown that rye malt worts contain less maltose and more nitrogen than barley malt worts. Further, rye malts tend to be richer than barley malts in alpha amylase, although barley malts provide slightly higher diastatic power. Including rye also increases the wort&amp;rsquo;s pH.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The rare heritage &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-2/RootShoot-Oland-wheat-malt.png">&lt;em>Ölandsvete&lt;/em> wheat malt&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> adds light caramel and roasty flavors, as well as full-bodied character.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Ölandsvete&lt;/em> (or &lt;em>Ølandsvete&lt;/em>) is an ancient variety of wheat first grown over 6,000 years ago on the second-largest Swedish island &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96land">Öland&lt;/a>, just off of Sweden&amp;rsquo;s east coast in the Baltic Sea. &lt;em>Ölandsvete&lt;/em> is a low-yield, high-protein (14%-16%) spring wheat that was once common all across Europe and northern Africa. Like many other heritage varieties, &lt;em>Ölandsvete&lt;/em> nearly disappeared &amp;ndash; until a few Swedish farmers started bringing it back in the late 1990s and local bakers started using it in traditional sourdough recipes. The Danish celeb chef Claus Meyer, for example, made a highly popular &lt;a href="https://meyers.dk/opskrifter/the-oland-wheat-bread/p/75089/">Öland bread&lt;/a>. Today, there are only a few farmers in the world who grow the &lt;em>Ölandsvete&lt;/em> variety. One of them is Olander Farms in Loveland, Colorado, the &lt;em>château&lt;/em> of Root Shoot Malting, which is quite possibly the only malthouse in the country to malt this variety. The Family Jones Distillery in Denver, Colorado uses this heritage wheat for its unique single-estate &lt;a href="https://thefamilyjones.co/#premium-spirits-section">Annika Jones Vodka&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Unmilled &lt;em>Ölandsvete&lt;/em> malt from Root Shoot smells sweet and nutty, with a hint of honeydew melon. Upon milling, that aroma becomes more pronounced. The fact that this variety came from Scandinavia, grown by farmers with Scandinavian ancestry, for a US baker making a Nordic-Baltic-style bread &amp;ndash; is quite interesting all around.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-2/RootShoot-honey-malt.png">&lt;strong>honey malt&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, from Genie (a 2-row spring barley), lends a pretzel aroma and some tropical tart sweetness. This malt is produced through a very distinct malting process, which makes it closely resemble a melanoidin malt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The honey malt, especially when freshly milled, has an absolutely intoxicating aroma and flavor. I don&amp;rsquo;t smell or taste grapefruit, but I do notice complex sweet tartness of mango, guava, passion fruit, soursop, and lychee; honeyed, tangy, tropical, and terrifically punchy citrus. It leaves an exclamation mark at the tip of my nose &amp;ndash; and reminds me of Java, Indonesia in March/April, when an abundance of tropical fruits are in season. I almost suggested to Root Shoot that they should rename the malt &amp;ldquo;Tropical Fruit Punch.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a real unique malt that I&amp;rsquo;m definitely going to use a lot more of in my breads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Process&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Grind the malts, individually or collectively, into a flour.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Place all the malts in a bowl or small saucepan; add hot water in 2-3 increments, stirring constantly.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Hold the scald at ~125°F for 2 hours; then raise the temperature to ~150°F and hold for another 6 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Upon initial mixing, the scald had a sweet roasty aroma and a sweet taste.&lt;/p>

alt="scald before saccharification"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>scald right after mixing, before saccharification&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>After saccharification, the sweet roasty aroma and taste went through the roof. Most people don&amp;rsquo;t have the opportunity to see or to experience this magical process. I&amp;rsquo;m extremely fortunate.&lt;/p>

alt="scald after saccharification"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>scald after saccharification&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Saccharification is an essential part of the brewing process. A few hundred years ago, making malt and brewing beer at home was a common activity. It happened on farms and in large households. It was a household task.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today it seems to be a mystery to many.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="caramelized-scald">Caramelized scald&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The trick with &lt;em>keptinis&lt;/em> is to properly caramelize the mash in the oven. You want a crust that is charred. Lithuanians typically bake the mash in a deep, wood-fired &lt;em>dúonkepis&lt;/em> oven (&amp;gt;700˚F) to achieve &lt;a href="https://www.curiouscook.com/site/2012/09/caramelization-new-science-new-possibilities.html">caramelization&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After 6 hours of saccharification, I scooped &lt;strong>400g&lt;/strong> (two-thirds) of the sweet scald onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and let the remaining 200g (one-third) continue saccharifying for another 2 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember I mentioned earlier that Dundulis' recent revival of &lt;em>keptinis&lt;/em> had ~55% of the mash baked to produce more of the right flavor? 2/3 (or ~67%) seemed about right to me, at least for starters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spread it out into a thin layer, to optimize the crust area for caramelization. Then I baked it in a 350°F oven for 20 minutes until it started to look dark brown in spots and smell toasty (and even slightly burnt).&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-2/20230404_225328.jpg"
alt="oven-caramelized scald"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>oven-caramelized sweet scald crackers&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The process of caramelization creates one of the most naturally delectable and complex combinations of sweet, savory, and bitter flavors there is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the water evaporates, the sugar concentration and the temperature of the sugar molecules continue to increase. The (now pure) molten sugar will rise above 212°F/100°C (the boiling point) and will go through its &lt;a href="https://www.joyofbaking.com/StagesOfCookedSugar.html">different cooking stages&lt;/a>. Gradually, the sugar molecules begin to break down and new compounds form (including caramel); the thermal decomposition accelerates significantly as the sugar reaches a temperature of 320°F (160°C).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IMO, it&amp;rsquo;s best to get a wide range of caramel colors, from the alluring darkest shades (with smokey bitter notes) to the lightest hues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key to caramelization is the combination of cooking temperature and cooking time. I find it absolutely fascinating that sugar can actually &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/dry-toasted-sugar-granulated-caramel-recipe">caramelize at temperatures below its melting point&lt;/a>. I speculate this scald might have a different flavor if it&amp;rsquo;s caramelized low and slow, e.g. baked in the gentler heat of a 300°F (149°C) oven for a few hours, or &lt;a href="https://www.curiouscook.com/site/2012/09/caramelization-new-science-new-possibilities.html">at 250°F (125°C) overnight and longer&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Caramelization will reduce fermentability, because caramelizing also binds simple sugars into more complex ones &amp;ndash; possibly too complex for the yeast to digest. Generally, yeast can digest only mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides. Anything more complex than that will remain in solution, adding some residual sweetness but not much (think &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-make-medieval-mead-bochet">bochets&lt;/a>&lt;/em>, a type of Medieval mead made from caramelized honey).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In reality, most of the colors and flavors of &amp;ldquo;caramelization&amp;rdquo; are actually due to Maillard reactions where the sugars interact with amino acids to make large and complex molecules. The amount of browning can be a good clue to how much of the sugars have bonded to create large molecules. The more brown the caramelized sugar, the less fermentable it will be. Some simple sugars are indeed created in the process, but the end result is larger flavor and aroma molecules, which are formed from the initial sugars present.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Caramelization doesn&amp;rsquo;t caramelize all sugar molecules, so some sugars will still remain fermentable. A number of Belgian beers use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candi_sugar">candi sugar&lt;/a>, a type of caramelized beet sugar, to add flavors, colors, as well as gravity points.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The caramelized scald turned out like a Nordic crispbread, but very sticky &amp;ndash; there was a layer of sticky syrupy substance underneath the parchment paper!&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Once the caramelized scald cooled off, I broke it up into smaller pieces. My 400g of liquidy scald yielded ~150g of dried concentrate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I ground them up in a coffee grinder into a flour. The ground flour smelled very toasty and caramelized &amp;ndash; like churro, cocoa, and bread crust.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After the remaining 200g scald had gone through another 2 hours of saccharification, I stirred all of the caramelized scald flour (~150g) back into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The scald instantly transformed into something much more wonderful &amp;ndash; a darker shade of chocolaty brown, with a seductive caramel aroma. After vigorous mixing, I let the newly-infused scald sit for another hour at ~150°F, so the flavors could meld.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 600g scald I started with got reduced down to 350g, and became much more concentrated in aromas and flavors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Total scald: 350g&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="barm-opshaug-kveik-ale-yeast">Barm: Opshaug kveik ale yeast&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I decided to inoculate the scald with White Labs' &lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=157&amp;amp;type=YEAST&amp;amp;style_type=1">WLP518&lt;/a> Opshaug kveik, a clean-fermenting farmhouse ale yeast from Norway.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>this Kveik strain was isolated from a mixed culture which belonged to Harald Opshaug, a farmhouse brewer in Stranda, Norway. This strain was originally used in the 1990s to produce several kornøl-style beers. It is a clean fermenting yeast and has tolerated temperatures up to 95°F (35°C) while finishing fermentation within three to four days. The hop-forward, clean characteristics of this strain make it ideal for IPAs and pale ales.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This yeast is traditionally used for Norwegian &lt;em>kornøl&lt;/em> (a farmhouse raw ale), and its low esters complement hops. Maybe it will complement the insanely malty character of the scald, too?&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how to get the most out of &lt;a href="https://www.milkthefunk.com/wiki/Kveik">kveiks&lt;/a>, based on my research:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Use an all-malt scald.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saccharify the scald as much as possible (&amp;gt;=6 hours).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use just a tiny bit of kveik (seriously underpitching).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ferment aerobically; oxygenate often.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ferment hot (~95°F).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I transferred all of the scald into a clean, shallow, wide-mouthed bowl. I let it cool down to ~95°F. Then I added 1g (~40 drops) of WLP518 liquid yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>

&lt;td>0.3%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>1g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>I covered the bowl loosely, and fermented it at &lt;strong>90-95°F&lt;/strong> for &lt;strong>7 hours&lt;/strong>. I gave it a stir every 30 minutes during the first 3 hours to aerate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After 6 hours, the barm more than doubled in volume and became very bubbly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I stirred it back down, and it bubbled back up again within an hour. Indeed, the kveik ferments a lot faster than common ale yeasts.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="tasting">Tasting&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The bread turned out quintessentially brown like a dark caramel. Its dense, opaque, and mysterious appearance reminded me of a brown ale rather than a questionable hazy IPA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Aroma&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bread had a very complex aroma: aggressively caramel upfront, followed by scents of chocolate, &lt;a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/english-toffee-520453">toffee&lt;/a>, molasses, and dark brown sugar; deeply malty and subtly wheaty. It reminded me of the sugary wafts of &lt;a href="https://walkers-nonsuch.co.uk/about-walkers/our-history/">Walker&amp;rsquo;s Nonsuch Toffee&lt;/a> in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, England.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aroma was so sweet and rich that it immediately transported me into an old-time candy shop where I was surrounded by handmade caramels, dark chocolate, truffles, fudge, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notes of toasted bread crusts, graham crackers, orange, and cinnamon sat contently in the background.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Texture&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The texture was decidedly chewy, soft, moist, and sticky; the tenderness reminded me a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/recipe/mantou-steamed-chinese-buns">Chinese steamed buns&lt;/a> (&lt;em>mantou&lt;/em>). Both the texture and the flavor reminded me of &lt;a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/nian-gao-recipe/">lunar new year sweet rice cake&lt;/a> (made with basic ingredients like brown sugar, water / coconut milk, and glutinous rice flour).&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Flavor&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The flavor was complex with immediate competition of toffee, toasted bread, orange, cinnamon, walnut, and molasses. There was a hint of butteriness and wheatiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The flavor kept on developing: There was an explosion of caramel and chocolate flavors as the bread first hit the tongue, balanced by a faintly hoppy undertone. When combined with the subtle earthiness of the grains, the malty flavors became more pronounced. The mildly sweet and nutty flavors of wholegrain wheat and rye started to shine through and became more endearing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I was about to swallow, the flavors deepened even further &amp;ndash; to rival the aggressively caramely and malty aroma I was smelling initially. Coupled with lingering hints of dates, raisins, plums, and chocolate, it made for a soul-satisfying taste.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>After I swallowed, the caramely flavor mellowed out and gently transitioned to some bitter / hoppy notes. This was followed by a deluge of saliva &amp;ndash; my mouth was begging for more of this flavor bomb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t recall ever having a bread with such a long progression of flavors that slowly marched across my taste buds or teased my palate in such deliberate ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the bread was toasted, the caramel flavor gave way to more burnt notes &amp;ndash; not acrid but more like the deep caramelization on the surface of grilled fruits. With further toasting, walnut and molasses took over the flavor. The bread was sweet, although less sweet as it toasted, but it was not cloying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This bread looked and tasted like it should be really sweet &amp;ndash; on par with the tooth-aching intensity of marshmallows, angel food cake, and fudge &amp;ndash; but it just isn&amp;rsquo;t. It&amp;rsquo;s gently sweet with an enjoyable toffee flavor, &lt;em>sans&lt;/em> toothaches.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mouthfeel&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crust was thin and crisp. The crumb was juicy (i.e. an evocative sensation that brought back sensory memories of biting into a ripe plum or peach, but not a juicy apple or pear) and soft, not heavy at all like its appearance or flavor suggested. It reminded me of eating a bowl of toasted oatmeal.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Overall&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was &amp;ndash; and still am &amp;ndash; honestly blown away by how good this bread turned out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The flavor was so deep and complex that it&amp;rsquo;s crazy to think this bread was made from just some austere barley, rye, and wheat without any specialty ingredients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of Baltic black breads, but this bread is radically different from any black bread I&amp;rsquo;ve ever tasted. It aligns very well with how people describe &lt;em>keptinis&lt;/em> from experienced brewers.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Hazy dark brown, thin, tan head. Aroma of brown bread, toast, chestnut, cashew, raisin, old banana. Taste has sweetish raisin &amp;amp; prune, sourish berries over brown-bready, almost wholemeal maltiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>an internet review of &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://brewver.com/beers/23908/Kurko-Keptinis">kurko keptinis&lt;/a>&lt;/em> from &lt;em>Širvenos Bravoras&lt;/em> (Dundulis)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is definitely an interesting twist on the Baltic bread tradition. Baking the saccharified scald into caramelized sugars is intriguing &amp;ndash; and kind of reminds me of &lt;a href="https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/13369/altus-amp-formula">altus&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/55979/alt-altus">alt altus&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bread had no weird fermentation character or sourness at all. The WLP518 Opshaug kveik strain helped a &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; grain flavor shine through &amp;ndash; just like the grain-forward &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/wlp001/">WLP001&lt;/a> California ale yeast did in my &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/byb-1-2/">previous bread-plays&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; underneath the complex caramely flavors. I have no doubt this bread will taste completely different if fermented with a sourdough levain instead of a kveik.&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>As mentioned in my &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-1-1/">last breadpost&lt;/a>, &lt;strong>barm&lt;/strong> is simply a thick yeasty froth or scum formed on the top of a fermenting liquid, like beer or wine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original method of making yeast bread in Britain was a by-product of ale-making. When traditional ale is made, a yeasty froth appears on top of the fermenting liquid (the wort). This used to be scooped off, washed, and then added to bread dough as a leaven. Bread made this way is sweet, light, and fluffy, and the leavening yeast used to be called &amp;ldquo;barm&amp;rdquo;. Its unpredictability gives us the word &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp;ldquo;barmy&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Barm first appeared in written records before the 12th century. It came from Middle English &lt;em>berme&lt;/em>, which came from Old English &lt;em>beorma&lt;/em>; it&amp;rsquo;s akin to Middle Low German &lt;em>berm&lt;/em> (yeast), Latin &lt;em>fermentum&lt;/em> (yeast), &lt;em>fervēre&lt;/em> (to boil), and Old Irish &lt;em>berbaid&lt;/em> (he boils). The word has been in use more loosely since the 13th century in reference to the foam or &amp;ldquo;head&amp;rdquo; of a pint of beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using barm to leaven bread appears to be an ancient method developed by Gaelic peoples in the mists of time (no wonder Scottish bakers were the last in Britain to ditch baking with barm), and was quite different from that used in Europe, i.e. leaven bread with a sourdough or leaven (called &amp;ldquo;levain&amp;rdquo; in French). When the Romans first conquered Gaul (modern-day France), they were astonished by the light sweet bread made by the Celtic inhabitants. Barm bread survived with the Celtic peoples in Britain, Scotland and Éire, but was not common in Europe &amp;ndash; in fact, it was even condemned during the Enlightenment as &amp;ldquo;unwholesome&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In England, noblemen&amp;rsquo;s bread &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchet">manchet&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; was always made with barm, whereas the commoners' bread &amp;ldquo;maslin&amp;rdquo; was usually leavened with a sourdough. Barm bread survived until World War II &amp;ndash; and even later in northern England largely as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barm_cake">barm cakes&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 19th century, the barm process was refined and industrialized; &amp;ldquo;yeast&amp;rdquo; began to be manufactured on a large scale, and used worldwide as &lt;em>the&lt;/em> method to leaven bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Curiously, the old method of making a sponge, i.e. a thick batter of flour and water with the barm, was still used with the new industrially-produced yeast, and was re-introduced to Europe from Vienna where the first yeast factories were established. Viennese bakers who emigrated to France around 1840 initiated the production of Viennese breads and other luxury bakery products in Paris using such technique. This became popular in France as a &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://bakerpedia.com/processes/poolish/">poolish&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; (an Old English version of &amp;ldquo;Polish&amp;rdquo;, as this method was first developed in Poland); bakers switched from using combinations of yeast and sourdough (&lt;em>sur levain&lt;/em>) to yeast alone for making crusty bread such as baguettes at bakeshops.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>At the beginning of the 20th century, barm was no longer universally held in high esteem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A 1902 domestic science book, &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://chestofbooks.com/food/science/Handbook-Of-Household-Science/Yeasts-Part-2.html">Hand-Book Of Household Science&lt;/a>&lt;/em> by Juniata L. Shepperd, considered acidity in barm bread a defect:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There is another variety of patent yeast known as &amp;ldquo;flour barm.&amp;rdquo; This is extensively used in Scotland. The chief peculiarity of bread from this is its decidedly acid taste, thought to be due principally to lactic acid. Much salt is used in making this bread, and it has not the flavor of what, in some other countries, is called the best bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A decade later, James Grant wrote in &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://archive.org/stream/grantsbreadchem00granrich/grantsbreadchem00granrich_djvu.txt">The Chemistry Of Breadmaking&lt;/a>&lt;/em> (1912):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Bread prepared by the aid of barms is generally of poor volume and colour, rather liable to be holey, with dull bloom and texture somewhat variable, but the flavour as a rule is good. Barms are suitable for working strong, harsh flours by long, slow processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Hmmmm. The artisanal, open-crumb, slightly tangy, naturally leavened bread &lt;em>en vogue&lt;/em> all over the US today was not beloved in Europe a century ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="WLP001 whole-wheat barm bread"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>whole-wheat barm bread, leavened exclusively with White Labs' WLP001 California ale yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Interestingly, the old barm method survived the invasions of Romans, Saxons and Normans. Which makes sense because it produced the sweetest, lightest bread in the right hands. Like other ancient breads, barm bread was highly digestible and nutritious because the ferments were never single strains like they are today, and included lactic acid bacteria which also gave the bread a marvelous flavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Barm bread has recently enjoyed some revival because it&amp;rsquo;s a characteristic ancient bread of Britain, a true heritage. Today some British bakers still add ale to bread dough to give it the ancient flavor, which sets the British bread culture apart from others. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame that the process was &lt;a href="https://sourdough.com/blog/enzyme-bread-tech">bastardized by industrialization&lt;/a> to produce modern unwholesome yeast breads.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="how-to-get-barm">how to get barm&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>So how do you get barm? There are several ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Option #1: You can always ask your neighborhood &lt;strong>craft brewers&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>home-brewing friends&lt;/strong> for some spare barm. It can be an interesting educational process, as apparently an ancient law declares that the brewer is bound to accede to your request. Your first task, though, is to convince the brewer that you mean to create bread with the barm and not a rival beer!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Option #2: &lt;a href="http://www.danlepard.com/">Dan Lepard&lt;/a>, an Australian-British baking celeb, has a famous &lt;strong>shortcut for a quick barm&lt;/strong> in his book &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://www.thehandmadeloaf.com/">The Handmade Loaf&lt;/a>&lt;/em>, intended for people who don&amp;rsquo;t have malts and hops lying around the kitchen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, it involves gelatinizing 1 part of white flour with 5 parts of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewing#Bottle_conditioning">bottle-conditioned&lt;/a> ale (heated to 158°F/70°C), letting it cool off to room temperature, and then inoculating with 0.4 part of leaven or yeast culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried his recipe, because there seems to be some weird contradiction. I bet a lot of people assume that the live yeast in the beer has something to do with making the bread rise. Nope, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Heating a fresh bottle of beer to &amp;gt;104°F (40°C) kills the live yeast in it, long before it reaches 158°F/70° where you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to whisk in the flour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You use bottle-conditioned beer for the same reasons you use freshly milled organic flour &amp;ndash; a bottle-conditioned beer has more flavor than one without. If you don&amp;rsquo;t understand these reasons, the recipe will still work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe the purpose of heating the beer is to cook off some of the alcohol, which retards the action of yeast. Lepard was effectively using the beer as a flavoring, and then re-introducing yeasts via a leaven; however lovely the results may be, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>not&lt;/em> a genuine barm bread. Lepard also says this is a perfect replica of the complex barm of the old times for the home bakers. Meh. I&amp;rsquo;m not satisfied with this method nor do I care for shortcuts. I want to make a barm from scratch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which leads me to option #3: &lt;strong>DIY from scratch&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>William Jago&amp;rsquo;s 1911 classic, &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/technologyofbrea00jagorich">The Technology of Bread-Making&lt;/a>&lt;/em>, gives three variations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>compound barm (malt and hops);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>virgin barm (spontaneous fermentation with flour and water only); and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parisian barm (malt and flour).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Compound barm&amp;rdquo; is essentially unboiled wort, made with malt, hops and water, and then inoculated with an existing culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Virgin barm&amp;rdquo;, containing only water and flour, differs from a sourdough starter in that it&amp;rsquo;s made with boiling water, i.e. the flour is gelatinized. Virgin barm should be left alone to ferment spontaneously, but even in 1911 bakers added &amp;ldquo;store&amp;rdquo; (an existing culture) to speed up the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Parisian barm&amp;rdquo; includes malt again, together with scalded flour, but no hops. Virgin barm differed from Parisian only in being self-fermented.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m interested in creating a barm that will increase the biodiversity of yeasts and maximize the aroma/flavor of the bread.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>John Kirkland, in his 1927 book &lt;em>The Baker’s ABC&lt;/em>, wrote about barm:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;since bakers, or others for them, began to make a fermenting agent for themselves, about 1800, that has been described as bar, while the word yeast has been retained for the brewery product, as well for the more modern article sold in more solid form. Barm contains yeast cells, generally as a variety of species, as well as some of the liquor in which the yeast has been grown. Barms are of many kinds and all degrees of “strength”; that is, a particular lot may contain few or many yeast cells and much or little of the acids, peptones, alcohols, &amp;amp;c., which have resulted from earlier fermentations. Probably the earliest barm made, as distinguished from leavens &amp;ndash; was that from malt and hops as the baker in the first instance merely copied the brewer or the distiller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This barm was known as compound or comp or patents. Some makers used a quantity of flour in the mixture, some did not. In Scotland, where barms were first made and where they continue in favour, the compound barm was displaced by a kind made with &lt;strong>scalded flour and malt&lt;/strong>. To this was given the name of &amp;ldquo;Parisian&amp;rdquo;, although no precise evidence to show that it was copied from the practice of Parisian bakers. Another sort which may contain a little malt , but may be all scalded and raw flour, is called “Virgin barm”.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If there is such a thing as a &amp;ldquo;Parisian barm&amp;rdquo;, then I first learned this &amp;ldquo;scalded flour and malt&amp;rdquo; method from &lt;em>Russian&lt;/em> bakers, not Parisians.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Parisian barm was introduced from Paris to Scotland in the late 19th century. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a scientific modification of the techniques of ancient Egypt and modern France.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>William Jago&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/technologyofbrea00jagorich">The Technology of Bread-Making&lt;/a>&lt;/em>, mentioned above, does offer a recipe for &amp;ldquo;Parisian barm&amp;rdquo;, supplied by a Mr. J. Meikle, who was apparently a well-known baker and bread writer familiar with the Scottish baking trade. Meikle&amp;rsquo;s descriptions show an evolution of baking practice beginning with, and developing away from, beer-brewing techniques.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is very similar to the &lt;em>opara&lt;/em> (yeasted scald-sponge) method I&amp;rsquo;ve always relied on to make complex Baltic rye breads.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Why does Wells include hops in Parisian barm and Jago doesn&amp;rsquo;t? I speculate there might be a few reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Barm made with hops is able to &amp;ldquo;overcome the power of foreign ferments longer than that made without hops, because the bitter of the hops is not suited to bacterial growth&amp;rdquo;, according to Shepperd&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>&lt;a href="http://chestofbooks.com/food/science/Handbook-Of-Household-Science/Yeasts-Part-2.html%20">Hand-Book Of Household Science&lt;/a>&lt;/em> (1902). However, &amp;ldquo;one can use but little of a yeast made with hops without injuring the flavor of the bread, and a weak yeast acts so slowly as to cause disastrous results, it is better to make yeast oftener without hops, and use plenty of it in bread making.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Since barm without hops didn&amp;rsquo;t keep as well, maybe some bakers just continued using hops to prevent barm spoilage while others didn&amp;rsquo;t. Pasteurisation arrived in the late 1870s and fewer hops were needed as a preservative. It certainly shows that disputes over what is or isn&amp;rsquo;t a poolish, a sourdough, a barm, etc. predate internet bread-geek forums.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Hopstalgia, i.e. carryover from tradition or reverence for the old days, when barm used to be made from malt and hops as the baker copied the brewer/distiller. As mentioned above, one of the reasons that bakers moved away from beer yeast in the first place was because the hops made it unpleasantly bitter. The older generations who had grown up eating hoppy barm bread most likely developed an acquired taste and nostalgia for it. Compound barm (malt and hops), for example, was considered by many of the older bakers to be &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>the&lt;/em> barm for flavour in bread&amp;rdquo;, according to Jago&amp;rsquo;s 1911 &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/technologyofbrea00jagorich">book&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 1: gelatinize the flour&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Put the whole wheat flour in a bowl; add hot water in 2-3 increments, stirring constantly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 2: saccharify the scald&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add the malt at the end (to prevent malt enzymes from being destroyed) and mix again. Cover and hold at 150-155°F for 6 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The scald becomes sweet/saccharified, since the diastatic malt contains amylase that converts starch into simple sugars. Saccharifying literally means &amp;ldquo;to convert into sugar.&amp;rdquo; Or, in more scientific words, saccharifying is the process of converting a sugar derivative or complex carbohydrate into a simple soluble fermentable sugar by hydrolysis.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Why scald the flour first?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order for the scald (&amp;ldquo;mash&amp;rdquo; in brewing) to be successful, we need heat and water to gelatinize the starch granules, essentially opening up their inner depths to expose the starch chains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, heat and water alone don&amp;rsquo;t break down starch into simpler sugars &amp;ndash; not on their own, anyway. In order to do that, we need enzymes. Malted barley, particularly pale (diastatic) malt, is packed with natural enzymes that can break down these long starch chains into much shorter fermentables that can be metabolized by yeasts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To the plant, starch serves as a reserve of energy that the embryo plant can use when it starts to germinate. In late summer to early fall, the seed falls off the stalk. If it immediately starts to grow after hitting the ground, it would grow too much before winter and not survive the cold. This also means that the seed comes off the stalk in a storage form known as starch, which is very hardy and doesn&amp;rsquo;t degrade nearly as quickly as sugar. So the seed will just sit in a field until the time is right for it to start growing. Then, when that time comes, many complex biological and chemical changes start to kick in, converting the starches into readily available sugars for the growing plant. Enzymes in the seed will activate, start degrading the cell walls, and break down the long chemical chains of starch into the short chains of maltose (a simple sugar). The growing plant can utilize this maltose until its stalk has poked above the surface of the ground, starting to produce its own sugar through photosynthesis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Malting mimics this natural process, so we can activate those enzymes that will convert the starch into sweet, tasty maltose that yeast loves to eat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Certain enzymes are produced during the malting process; the two major ones are α-amylase and β-amylase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A-amylase basically liquefies starch and turns it into a carbohydrate stew. It also chops up the starch at 1-4 links. Every time it cuts the chain, a reducing end and a non-reducing end are formed on the chain. Β-amylase can work only on the non-reducing end. It will lop off 2 molecules of the carb stew and blend with one water molecule, producing maltose. B-amylase also can lop off 3 molecules of starch, mixing with one water molecule producing maltriose. Maltriose is the sugar that yeast use during lagering phase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After α-amylase and β-amylase can reduce the chain no further, α-limit and β-limit dextrins are formed. β-limit dextrin can chop the starch down to a 1-6 link. Once, the enzyme gets to a branch, they&amp;rsquo;re done. Enzymes such as dextrinase and maltase are de-branching enzymes, typically destroyed during the kilning of modern malts. There are a limited amount left in minimally modified pilsner malt. De-branching enzymes help α-amylase and β-amylase produce many non-reducing ends. The more the non-reducing ends, the more β-amylase has to work with &amp;ndash; and faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brewers typically boil their wort after mashing to sanitize it and to boost hop utilization (among other things), which denatures all the enzymes. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t nuke the saccarified scald like brewers (leaving it a &amp;ldquo;raw ale&amp;rdquo;), I get to keep the valuable secondary enzymes in play for more starch conversion to take place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondary enzymes, compared to their amylase cousins, aren&amp;rsquo;t very active under thermophilic conditions. However, they do become more active during mesophilic fermentation and give us a &amp;ldquo;secondary conversion&amp;rdquo; in beerspeak. This secondary conversion actually increases the amount of fermentable sugars by as much as 15%, which is a huge boost to plant efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like a beer mash, there are many kinds of sugars in saccharified scald:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>fructose, glucose, and sucrose: ~30%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>maltose: ~45%, which, like trehalose, is made from 2 glucose molecules, but with a different bond between them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>maltotriose: ~20%, which is 3 glucose molecules, with the exact same bond between them as in maltose.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The increased concentration of sugar could lead to caramelization, which makes the beer less fermentable (among other things). Since I&amp;rsquo;m not after alcohol production, this is not a problem. In fact, the extra sugar might even enhance the flavor profile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, I used &lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=101&amp;amp;type=YEAST">WLP001 California ale yeast&lt;/a> in this barm. WLP001 has an attenuation rate of 73%-85%.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="WLP001 California Ale Yeast"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>A homebrew pouch of WLP001 California Ale Yeast, from White Labs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In brewing, attenuation refers to the conversion of sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide by the fermentation process; the greater the attenuation, the more sugar has been converted into alcohol. A more attenuated beer is drier and more alcoholic than a less attenuated beer made from the same wort. High-attenuating yeast indicates that the particular strain ferments more of the sugars available in a wort relative to other yeast strains. This results in a drier finish in the finished beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A 50% attenuation rate means that 50% of the sugars have been converted into alcohol and CO₂ by yeast. A 100% attenuation means all of the sugars have been consumed by yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beer fermented with normal brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast will never have 100% attenuation. A 100% fermentable sugar solution will only attenuate to the level that the yeast can tolerate the alcohol or lack of nutrients; whereas in a wort that contains 30% non-fermentables; a yeast that can go to 80% attenuation will stop at 70% attenuation because there is nothing left to ferment. This is important because it can help predict the final gravity and alcohol content of a beer. A yeast with low attenuation will leave a beer with more sugar and more body than a yeast with high attenuation. This can also be very helpful when selecting a yeast strain for a recipe.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You should let the yeast know what it is to ferment. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a living thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ndash; Yves Benoit, head brewmaster at Brouwerij De Brabandere&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Fermentability of a wort is based on much more than temperature of the mash. The composition of the grist (e.g. total diastatic power) can have a much bigger effect than temperature alone. Unfermentable sugars have the greatest impact on your attenuation than any other factors. You can turn a dry stout into a sweet one by adding just lactose. Usually, the more the non-fermentables in the mash (crystal malt, partially kilned malt, etc), the lower the attenuation. Manipulating temperatures is a tool for overcoming the limitations of the grist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Brewing_with_Wheat.html?id=jc2QAwAAQBAJ">&lt;em>Brewing with Wheat&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, Stan Hieronymus mentions how brewers change their mash profile for each batch of grain, knowing that while it all may be wheat, the wheat from one particular farmer is different than the wheat from another. This is exactly like baking bread with different wheat varieties from different farms!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 3: inoculate with yeast&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let the scald cool off gradually to ~75°F. Add &lt;strong>2.5g of WLP001&lt;/strong> (~100 drops); stir vigorously and mix thoroughly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ferment at &lt;strong>70°F-73°F&lt;/strong> (high end of WLP001&amp;rsquo;s recommended temperature range of 64°F-73°F) to bring out the yeast&amp;rsquo;s character. After &lt;strong>12 hours&lt;/strong>, the barm doubled in volume and started to fall and pull away from the sides of the bowl. It was ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Given the liquid yeast contains about 2.5 billion cells per mL and 2.5g has roughly 6.25 billion cells, the inoculation rate in the barm is about 16 million cells per gram.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite lower inoculation, I could tell the yeast was having much more fun in this saccharified scald loaded with nutrients than in the previous &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-1-1/">straight poolish&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mr. J. Meikle was certainly spot on:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Parisian barm while fermenting behaves like a thin ferment made with distillers' yeast, sugar and a handful of flour, only the bells and gas bubbles are larger and brighter.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The barm has the strength, without the &amp;ldquo;rampness,&amp;rdquo; of compound, and the mildness without the weakness of Virgin.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The bread had a springy and chewy texture, and a nutty, slightly salty flavor that&amp;rsquo;s noticeably more complex than the &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/byb-1-1/">straight poolish verison&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tasted the same &lt;strong>clean, robust wheat flavor&lt;/strong> without a trace of tanginess, like eating Triscuit® Original whole wheat crackers (America&amp;rsquo;s favorite shredded wheat snacks), the opposite of sourdough breads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever tasted a bread with such a dominating wheat flavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Just like how WLP001 accentuates hop flavors in beers, I think the yeast accentuates wheat flavors in breads. The flavor of Turkey Red seems 5x-10x amplified in this WLP001 bread than in any of my sourdough breads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The closest beer comparison I could think of is probably &lt;a href="https://www.anchorbrewing.com/blog/american-wheat-beers-heritage-and-history/">&lt;strong>American wheat beer&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, something like &lt;a href="https://www.anchorbrewing.com/beer/summer_beer">Anchor Brewing&amp;rsquo;s Summer® Wheat&lt;/a>, the first American wheat beer brewed since Prohibition and released in the summer of 1984: medium-bodied, wheat-emphatic, clean and balanced; a smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Adding 2% salt to the final dough was a good idea &amp;ndash; the extra salt opened up the taste buds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bread tasted great with a sharp cheddar and good mustard like Alstertor beer mustard, which IMO is the Charlize Theron of mustards: smooth, but not without an edge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s nothing like sitting down at the end of a day with a glass of your own fresh ale and a loaf of fresh homemade bread. The only thing to add might be homemade cheese or prosciutto!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t think retarding beer yeast doughs at lower temperatures, as you would with sourdough breads, contributes much in terms of flavor or texture. It only makes scheduling easier.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>How is this barm related to the adjective &lt;em>barmy&lt;/em>? When it first emerged in the language in the early 1500s, the adjective &lt;em>barmy&lt;/em> meant precisely that: full of froth, foam, or barm. But before long a figurative meaning had developed, so that by the early 17th century people who were just as excitably lively or as bubbly as a pint of beer&amp;rsquo;s foaming barm were being described in equivalent terms. From there, the more recent use of barmy to mean &amp;ldquo;unhinged&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;deranged&amp;rdquo;, or generally &amp;ldquo;not thinking straight&amp;rdquo; emerged &amp;ndash; the latter of which, at least, could always be blamed on consuming a bit too much barm.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

While many people were driven to drink more during the Covid lockdown, I went the other way. I do have tanks of Russian &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvass">kvass&lt;/a>&lt;/em> and Romanian &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bor%C8%99_(bran)">borș&lt;/a>&lt;/em> brewing in house all the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For some time now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by the centuries-old relationship between beer and bread &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely gripping, and the more I learn, the more gripping it gets. Today, for instance, I was learning about the old, strong relationship in Europe between bakers and brewers. Ages ago, breweries and bakeries lived side-by-side harmoniously. Brewers happily went about their noble work &amp;ndash; mashing, sparging, and fermenting. One blessed by-product of the brewing process was a foam that formed frothily on top of the fermenting liquor. The dusty baker next door would welcome consignments of this malty foam &amp;ndash; known as &amp;ldquo;barm&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and utilize the natural yeasts in it to leaven his dough. It made perfect sense, and as historical records have shown, ale and bread were the staple diet in the old days.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;As we brew, so we bake.&amp;rdquo; - an old adage&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Previously, I had thought that before commercial yeasts were developed, all bakers used sourdough to make their bread. Nope! Up until the 19th century, village bakers either depended on village brewers for their yeast (&amp;ldquo;barm&amp;rdquo;) in order to leaven their bread, or they literally brewed up their own &amp;ldquo;barm&amp;rdquo; for baking.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Andreas Krennmair&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em>Vienna Lager&lt;/em>, has an interesting take on how the relationship between brewers and bakers changed in the 19th century when brewers switched from ales to lagers:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Industrialisation had a profound effect on other breweries in and around Vienna: because of the quick success of Anton Dreher&amp;rsquo;s beer and brewing methods, all other breweries switched to bottom fermentation just within a few years. This rapid change had an unintended implication for another craft that had previously been reliant on breweries: baking. In the centuries before, bakers had been reliant on fresh beer yeast, which brewers always had available in abundance. When brewers started switching to bottom fermentation, the yeast given to bakers also changed its properties: &amp;hellip;the yeast suddenly contained hop bittering compounds and hop resins that turned these yeast darker and bitter-tasting, making it unsuitable for baking. &amp;hellip;so the Viennese baker&amp;rsquo;s guild announced in 1845 that they would award a prize to the person who could produce a leaven that was suitable to replace the much sought-after top-fermenting beer yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Coincidentally, the 1800s were the golden age of the hop industry; hop acreage reached its peak in 1878.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the end of the century, yeast specifically cultivated for breadmaking had become commercially available in blocks, and later in dry, granulated forms. Slowly &amp;ndash; and sadly &amp;ndash; the close bond between breweries and bakeries faded away.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.toastale.com/">Toast Ale&lt;/a>, a London-based craft brewery, makes beer from waste bread. In the &lt;a href="https://www.willhawkes.net/blog/2023/3/20/march2023newsletter">March 2023 edition&lt;/a> of Will Hawkes&amp;rsquo;s newsletter &lt;em>London Beer City&lt;/em>, Toast&amp;rsquo;s founder talked about the company&amp;rsquo;s funding (some from Heineken), marketing strategy (&amp;ldquo;buyer personas&amp;rdquo;) and business model:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>While the impact of bread on the flavour of the beer is limited (typically, bread replaces 25 percent of the malted barley), I’ve always thought the implied message of Toast, that you can make great beer out of old bread, was a difficult one for the brewing industry. What happened to the ‘finest malt and hops’?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;those who drink Toast’s beers are at ease with the idea of surplus bread being used to make it. In common with most people, I suspect, they don’t really care about malt and hops. They just want something nice to drink.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The idea of making bread with breweries' by-products has intrigued me for a long time. I&amp;rsquo;ve baked and enjoyed &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/breadford-von-regrainton/">breads infused with brewer&amp;rsquo;s spent grains&lt;/a>, as well as ones leavened with &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/yeast-water/">wild yeasts captured from fruits&lt;/a>. But how about baking bread with brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="bakers-yeast-vs-brewers-yeast">baker&amp;rsquo;s yeast vs. brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the mid-19th century, when bakers ditched breweries' barms &lt;em>en masse&lt;/em> and started looking for new sources of yeast, for a few years a new trade of &amp;ldquo;barm-brewers&amp;rdquo; sprang up who specialized in propagating yeast for bakers.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This in turn was displaced by the introduction of compressed blocks of yeast known as &amp;ldquo;fresh yeast&amp;rdquo; today. As &lt;a href="https://dafteejit.com/2020/03/the-history-of-modern-baking-yeast/">Andreas Krennmair writes&lt;/a>, the process of making compressed yeast was invented by a brewer, who used brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast. This has inspired Lars Marius Garshol to ponder, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.garshol.priv.no/blog/411.html">Does bread yeast exist?&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, most forms of brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast and baker&amp;rsquo;s yeast currently on the market all come from the same species of yeast called &lt;em>&lt;code>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/code>&lt;/em>. The yeast derives its name from the Latinized Greek meaning &amp;ldquo;sugar fungus&amp;rdquo;, because it converts sugars into CO₂ and ethanol during aerobic fermentation &amp;ndash; which makes beer alcoholic and inflates a lump of dough into a fluffy loaf of bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> strains share a common natural history. Some, through artificial selection, are better adapted for certain processes, while others have more than one use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the arrival of industrial yeasts, baker&amp;rsquo;s yeast used to be much more diverse, but what we call &amp;ldquo;bread yeast&amp;rdquo; today is simply particular strains of &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> monocultures that have been selected by yeast manufacturers primarily for their ability to rapidly metabolize wheat starch, produce large quantities of CO₂ while fermenting the dough, and make bread light. The quick-rising yeast now available in stores is an improved strain developed using modern genetic methods. Professional bakers use commercial yeasts that produce a fast and strong rise and a clean taste (less flavor and depth) in the finished loaf of bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Modern bread yeast manufacturers narrowly focus their yeast development on two issues:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>gas production.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>speed of rising.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Variants are produced with these goals in mind, to suit different technical requirements of the baking industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, instant yeasts (aka. fast-rising, rapid-rise, quick-rise, and bread machine yeast), are manufactured to dissolve more quickly than active dry yeasts; they can be mixed directly into flour and other dry ingredients, without the need to &amp;ldquo;proof&amp;rdquo; the yeast in warm water first. Lesaffre, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest yeast producers, has formulated &lt;a href="https://lesaffre.ae/en/our-products/professional-products/saf-instant-gold-500g/">Saf-Instant® Gold dry yeast&lt;/a> specifically for sweet doughs (with &amp;gt;=5% sugar/weight of flour) like Hawaiian rolls and &lt;em>panettoni&lt;/em>, as well as &lt;a href="https://lesaffrebaking.com/product/saf-instant-red/">Saf-Instant® Red&lt;/a> that excels in sugarless doughs.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>A number of people claim that baker&amp;rsquo;s yeast brews good beers (since most bread yeasts are &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->phenolic&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A 2018 paper published in the &lt;em>Journal of the Institute of Brewing&lt;/em>, titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jib.503">evaluation of &lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em> strains isolated from non-brewing environments in beer production&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, tested 12 novel &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> strains isolated from grape must, bakery, wine, and apple stillage in the production of beer. The researchers found that&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The most suitable strain for beer production, based on fermentative ability and volatile profile, was a baker&amp;rsquo;s yeast&amp;hellip;. Interestingly, some esters were above the sensory threshold.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Another example: The Finnish farmhouse ale &lt;em>sahti&lt;/em> is fermented with baking strains, rather than &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->brewing strains&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, of &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em>. A 2020 paper, titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jib.608">sourdough derived strains of &lt;em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/em> and their potential for farmhouse ale brewing&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, concludes&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>sourdough isolates of &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> are suitable for &lt;em>sahti&lt;/em> production, but could also be applied to other beer styles as a way to differentiate products.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>However, I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard the other way round, i.e. brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast makes good bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Manufacturers of beer and wine yeasts all describe multiple varieties of yeasts, each producing a slightly differently flavored product. In the case of wine, some yeasts are tied to specific cultivars of grapes. The importance of yeast strains in producing different varieties of beer is illustrated by White Labs' assortment of beer yeasts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=169&amp;amp;type=YEAST">WLP566&lt;/a> Belgian Saison II Ale Yeast: &amp;ldquo;a moderate phenol producer with clove-like flavor and aromatic notes present in the finished beer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=174&amp;amp;type=YEAST">WLP590&lt;/a> French Saison Ale Yeast: &amp;ldquo;produces flavors and aromas of pear, apple and cracked pepper&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=267&amp;amp;type=YEAST">WLP077&lt;/a> Tropicale Yeast Blend: &amp;ldquo;a balance of tropical flavors and aromas, such as passionfruit, grapefruit, and mango&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be lovely to be able to make a bread that produces a &amp;ldquo;clove-like&amp;rdquo; aroma and flavor when it&amp;rsquo;s toasted? Or a loaf with a slight hint of smoky tomato that might make it ideal for &lt;em>bruschetta&lt;/em>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if breads in a bakery might, for the first time, be differentiated by subtleties of aroma? Imagine a boule with a hint of plum and thyme under an overtone of apple &amp;ndash; next to a boule made with the same recipe but a different yeast and thus yielding a hazelnut aroma.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Beer is, after all, liquid bread. Like brewers, I&amp;rsquo;m constantly on the lookout for special flours and yeasts to make that unique, satisfying loaf.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I keep thinking about experimenting with combinations of different yeast strains in a dough to see how they might enhance a bread&amp;rsquo;s flavor and aroma. The yeast monoculture practice be damned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does it take to make a good loaf of bread with brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast? Is it possible in the modern era? I want to find out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a vast catalog of yeast strains used by brewers and wine makers that I want to experiment with, and it&amp;rsquo;s never been easier to collaborate with people over the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="california-ale-yeast">California ale yeast&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The first craft beer yeast I decided to experiment is &lt;a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=101&amp;amp;type=YEAST">WLP001&lt;/a> California Ale Yeast®, which is White Labs' OG yeast strain, first produced in 1995.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp;ldquo;Chico&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> strain (named after the &lt;em>châteaux&lt;/em> of Sierra Nevada Brewing Company) is probably the most widely used beer strain on the West Coast, if not in the entire country. It&amp;rsquo;s a driving force behind IPA 2.0, aka. the yeast that launched 1,000 beers.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>WLP001 is famous for its clean flavors and hardy fermentations and is known for its use in hoppy beers. It accentuates hop flavors and aromas and attenuates well, even for high-gravity beers. A higher-than-average attenuation leads to drier beers as well as medium flocculation to leave a clean and crisp beer. With a healthy pitch and yeast, WLP001 is also quick at reabsorbing diacetyl.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The yeast has a very beery aroma right out of the package.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A &amp;ldquo;clean-fermenting&amp;rdquo; strain with a neutral flavor and aroma profile (instead of a &amp;ldquo;fruity&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;estery&amp;rdquo; strain) would be an interesting baseline for comparisons with other yeasts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another reason for starting with WLP001 is that a clean fermenter showcases a brewer&amp;rsquo;s recipe formulation (e.g. choice of malts, hops, brewing temperatures, and fermentation temperatures) more than other strains. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve made &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/pan-de-cristal/">these kinds of breads&lt;/a> many times, it&amp;rsquo;d be fairly easy for me to tell how the ale yeast differs from sourdough.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="wlp001-poolish">WLP001 poolish&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Many researchers have reported that the dough fermentation by &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> promoted an increase in the contents of phenolic compounds due to the structural breakdown of cell wall, leading to the liberation of phenolic compounds and/or metabolization of phenolics by yeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, thermal processing may have negative effects on these bioactive compounds, likely caused by oxidation, isomerization, and interaction with wheat proteins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One technical challenge of baking with yeast is making the yeast&amp;rsquo;s distinct character shine through.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe a poolish (a preferment with 25% of total flour) with super low yeast inoculation would help? A poolish particularly elevates the bread&amp;rsquo;s creamy, slightly nutty character and crisp, thin crust. (Yum.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I made a loose preferment that used roughly equal parts of whole wheat flour and water by weight with a tiny bit of California ale yeast &amp;ndash; and no salt.&lt;/p>

&lt;td>2.5g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>I mixed the whole wheat flour and water together in a &lt;strong>shallow, wide-open bowl&lt;/strong>. I prefer it to tall, narrow fermenters because high hydrostatic pressure and CO₂ levels tend to inhibit ester formation.&lt;/p>

alt="WLP001 yeast poolish, before fermentation"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>WLP001 yeast poolish, before fermentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I added ~100 drops of WLP001, which totaled ~2.5g. I whipped it vigorously into the mixture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>White Labs' homebrew yeasts typically have a concentration of &amp;gt;=100 billion cells per 40 mL, i.e. 2.5 billion cells per mL. Assume 2.5g of the liquid yeast contains roughly 6.25 billion cells, the inoculation rate in the poolish is about 22-23 million cells per gram.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>These [West Coast] yeasts have a potential ester profile. If you play with fermentation temperature, you can really influence the character of the beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Richard Norgrove, Bear Republic Brewing Company (Healdsburg, California)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>WLP001 has a fermentation temperature range of 64°F-73°F. I loosely covered up the poolish (leaving an air gap) and let it ferment at the high side of the recommended temperatures (&lt;strong>70°F-73°F&lt;/strong>), in order to bring out the yeast&amp;rsquo;s character. I checked on it every few hours and gave it a stir to aerate the mixture.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I provided WLP001 all the time it needed to propagate, and let the poolish tell me when it was done. It ended up going for &lt;strong>48 hours&lt;/strong>. This was to ensure vigorous and complete fermentation before the poolish was mixed into the final dough.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Clean strains usually ferment more slowly than fruitier strains and flocculate at a medium rate, remaining in suspension long enough to condition the beer properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When ripe, the poolish doubled in volume. It was brimming with almost uniform micro-bubbles, instead of the bigger, more irregular bubbles you get with sourdough or bread yeast.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Upon initial mixing, the mixture had a mild toasty wheat aroma from freshly milled Turkey Red wheat. The toasty wheat aroma was replaced by a slight yeasty twang after 12 hours, so I assume that&amp;rsquo;s when the yeast started working. After 48 hours, the yeasty aroma was completely gone. The smell was very clean &amp;ndash; maybe with a hint of fresh beer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A quick search on home-brewing forums show that &lt;a href="https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/wlp001-peach-flavor.211921/">peach esters&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/wlp001-flocculation-and-clearing.242072/">slow flocculation&lt;/a> seem to be the two major complaints people have with WLP001. Neither is a problem for my bread.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I decided &lt;em>not&lt;/em> to use a levain (sourdough), in order to have a more clean aroma/flavor profile of the ale yeast. So, this dough was leavened purely by a poolish with WLP001.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Mix in the salt. Let the dough rest for a few minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gently mix in the olive oil. Let the dough rest and relax for 30 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bulk ferment the dough at &lt;strong>~73°F&lt;/strong> for &lt;strong>8 hours&lt;/strong>, performing a coil-fold every 45 minutes during the first 3 hours.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The crumb had almost uniform micro-bubbles &amp;ndash; just like the poolish &amp;ndash; rather than the bigger, irregular air holes you get with sourdough or bread yeast.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It had a very clean wheat flavor &amp;ndash; something I hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed in a sourdough bread and it really stood out to me in this bread. It reminded me of eating Triscuits, with a slight hint of dankness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think this clean and neutral bread would be a good baseline for my upcoming craft beer yeast experiments.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ale strains of &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> are &amp;ldquo;top-fermenting&amp;rdquo; (I prefer &amp;ldquo;top-harvesting&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;warmish-fermenting&amp;rdquo; for clearer communication) yeasts. They are relatively hydrophobic, such that upon flocculating or clumping together, they tend to connect to the CO₂ produced and float to the surface of the fermenter contents. As a result, brewers were able to collect the yeast and create more colonies for future beers. On the other hand, lagers are made with &lt;em>S. pastorianus&lt;/em> strains, which are &amp;ldquo;bottom-fermenting&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;bottom-harvesting&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cold-fermenting&amp;rdquo;, to be more specific) and widely thought to have originated from a natural hybridization event that occurred between a &lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> strain and a non-&lt;em>S. cerevisiae&lt;/em> strain, probably a &lt;em>S. bayanus&lt;/em> strain.

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The Imperial Valley in southern California is often cited as a great example of modern desert agriculture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, the Imperial Valley is a place of jarring contrasts. Half of the valley remains in its natural state, aka. a bone-dry desert with some breathtaking sand dunes; the other half exemplifies a modern engineering marvel &amp;ndash; mile after mile of green fields lined by irrigation canals and sometimes shrouded by showers of water from sprinklers.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="Map of Imperial Valley, California"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Imperial Valley is one of the oldest farming communities in the Colorado River basin. It lies in the Colorado Desert section of the Sonoran Desert, with overwhelming heat and meager average rainfall (about 3&amp;quot; or 76 mm per year). Dirt was carried here over millions of years by the Colorado River, as it carved the Grand Canyon ever deeper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to irrigation &amp;ndash; that is, thanks to the US Bureau of Reclamation &amp;ndash; states such as California, Arizona, and Idaho became populous and wealthy; millions settled in regions where nature, left alone, would have countenanced thousands at best; great valleys and hemispherical basins metamorphosed from desert blonde to semi-tropical green.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Agriculture is the economic backbone of the Imperial Valley due to irrigation, which is supplied entirely from the Colorado River via the All-American Canal. Thousands of acres of prime farmland have transformed the desert into one of the most productive farming regions in California with an annual crop production of over $1 billion. Evidently, agriculture accounts for nearly half of all local employment.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Unlike the Central Valley in the north which draws its water from rain and snow in the Sierra Mountains or pumps it from shrinking underground aquifers, the Imperial Valley has only one source of water: the Colorado River, 80 miles to the east.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most basic principle governing water use in the western US is &amp;ldquo;first in time, first in right.&amp;rdquo; These lush fields in the Imperial Valley owe their existence to fortune-seeking land speculators and engineers who arrived early and, starting in 1901, dug the first canal to ship water here from the Colorado River. (Prior to the 20th century, this patch was mostly unsettled.) Since most of the Imperial Valley actually lies below sea level &amp;ndash; and well below the canal&amp;rsquo;s starting point on the Colorado River near Yuma, Arizona &amp;ndash; water is able to flow there by gravity alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to the stunning wealth that irrigation farming had produced, California came rolling out of the 1920s like Jay Gatsby in his alabaster phaeton. Agriculture was California; there were no sprawling defense and aerospace industries, no Silicon Valley.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Salton Sea was an unfortunate consequence of the engineering failure that marked the construction of the original canal. The current canal, built during the New Deal and named the &lt;a href="https://www.iid.com/water/water-transportation-system/colorado-river-facilities/all-american-canal">All-American Canal&lt;/a>, began delivering water to the Imperial Valley in 1940; two years later, it became the sole water source for Imperial Valley&amp;rsquo;s residents and farmlands.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Water delivered to the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) each year by the All-American Canal &amp;ndash; through a vast system of canals, dams, and pipelines &amp;ndash; is enough to cover the entire irrigated land, roughly 500,000 acres, with 5 feet of water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imported water and a long growing season allow two crop cycles each year; the Imperial Valley now supplies over 2/3 of winter fruits and vegetables, cotton, and grain for domestic and international markets. The valley also produces most of the lamb and sheep in the US. (This raises a bunch of uncomfortable questions: What&amp;rsquo;s the rest of America doing? Why is the whole nation dependent on a few hundred farms concentrated in an irrigated desert for its food? How did this situation come to be? What happened to Eliot Coleman&amp;rsquo;s four-season farming revolution? &amp;hellip; )&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Alfalfa is the king crop produced in the Imperial Valley. 1 out of every 3 farmed acres in the valley is dedicated to growing alfalfa, which dries into a high-protein hay commonly used as food for livestock. It&amp;rsquo;s also one of the thirstiest drop; its deep roots sucking up water in a region scorched by a 22-year drought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another contradiction of California: How does irrigating alfalfa in 120°F temperatures in the dead of July make any sense at all?&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The Imperial Valley&amp;rsquo;s alfalfa industry is not only one of the largest water users in the basin, but also one of the most powerful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Large-scale production of water-gorging, low-value crops like alfalfa during a megadrought is possible only because the Imperial Valley is the single biggest controller of rights to Colorado River water and the IID farmers have access to cheap (subsidized) water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to these massive irrigation projects, south of the canal, the Colorado River no longer flows above ground at all for much of the year into Mexico.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Colorado River, which supplies freshwater to more than 40 million people in the southwestern US and northern Mexico, has been in rapid decline. Reduced snowpack, drought conditions and higher average temperatures have all reduced the river&amp;rsquo;s flow in recent decades. The two biggest reservoirs along the river, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are each creeping towards a &amp;ldquo;dead pool,&amp;rdquo; an ominous sign that the Colorado River could stop flowing entirely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Agriculture accounts for ~80% of total water consumption in the Colorado River basin, with roughly half of that going towards the production of alfalfa hay, according to a 2020 &lt;a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/323061602.pdf">study&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-pygL1-yzM" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>What has all this irrigation amounted to?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Massive industrial storehouses line the area, packed with thousands upon thousands of stacks of alfalfa bales ready to be fed to dairy cows &amp;ndash; but not cows in California&amp;rsquo;s Central Valley or Montana&amp;rsquo;s rangelands. Instead, the alfalfa will be fed to cows across the Pacific &amp;ndash; in China, Japan and Korea, and farther away in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, etc. An increasing percentage of the alfalfa produced here is exported.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Growers say the reasons boil down to simple economics. The market for alfalfa hay in southern California has shrunk over the years as dairies have closed or moved elsewhere, while demand for dairy products has grown exponentially in other parts of the world. Meanwhile, it costs little to freight goods on the back haul to China, because the US runs a persistently high trade deficit with China; containers from Asia arrive full but often return empty. Some claim it&amp;rsquo;s actually cheaper to ship hay to China than to haul the same load by truck to dairy farms 400 miles north in the San Joaquin Valley.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brokers regularly fly in from overseas, some staying at a local golf course and country club. Chinese buyers are wined and dined across the border in Mexicali, which has a long-established Chinese community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to a 2015 &lt;a href="https://pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CA-Ag-Water-Use.pdf">analysis&lt;/a> by the Pacific Institute, alfalfa production in California uses around 5 acre-feet (6,167 cubic meters) of water. In comparison, sugar beets use roughly 3 acre-feet (3,700 cubic meters), and grains as little as 1 acre-foot (1,233 cubic meters).&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EE4uMOtqIc8" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The top water-using activity in California is growing alfalfa. Farmers in Imperial County currently draw more water from the Colorado River than all of Arizona and Nevada combined. An alfalfa farmer can grow alfalfa 10-12 times a year and sell it for $260-$280/ton. These are not the hardworking family farmers of yesteryear. They are giant agribusiness corporations pulling in $1.8 billion from selling 7 million tons of alfalfa every year in California, according to a University of California, Davis study by Daniel Geisseler and William R. Horwath.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This business has been extremely profitable because alfalfa farmers get 3.4 million acre-feet (1 acre foot =325,851 gallons) of water every year for only $35-$60 per acre-foot. The water you get for your house costs you $800 per acre-foot today, and it could be double that in 10 years' time. You could supply the water needs of 40 million people with that 3.4 million acre-feet. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that enough water for greater Los Angeles is being used to raise irrigated pasture for livestock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feeding irrigated grass to cows is as wasteful a use of water as you can conceive. Pasture is hydrologically inefficient in the extreme, and, metabolically speaking, so are cows: You need 7-8 feet of water in the hot deserts to keep grass alive, which means that you need ~50,000 pounds of water to raise 1 pound of cow. (Feeding alfalfa to cows requires even more water, but at least alfalfa fixes nitrogen in the soil.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the livestock industry earned California any real money, and if cows (unlike avocados or artichokes) couldn&amp;rsquo;t be raised on rainfall in 35 other states, then giving more water to cows than to humans in the nation&amp;rsquo;s richest and most populous state &amp;ndash; a semi-desert state at the mercy of a precarious water supply &amp;ndash; might make a grain or two of sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>During the last few years, companies from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have established farming operations on thousands of acres around the Imperial Valley and the adjacent Palo Verde Valley.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Saudi Arabian companies are pumping up groundwater from beneath land they have purchased and are using it to grow alfalfa for export to the Middle East. They have no plan for replacing this scarce and finite groundwater that accumulated over thousands of years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a matter of fact, foreign corporations have increased purchases of farmland in the US, particularly in the southwest where longstanding laws on water rights give land owners unlimited access to the valuable water underneath the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why don&amp;rsquo;t they grow their own alfalfa? Because they are short of water and it&amp;rsquo;s so much cheaper to buy from the US.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Growing water-intensive crops in the US and exporting them to water-scarce countries is a form of geo-economic arbitrage, a natural consequence of the globalization of everything. Essentially, water is exported out of the US in the form of crops like alfalfa, rice, or almonds. Guess who is currently one of the largest net exporters of virtual water in the world?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This trend has been accelerating for decades, despite concerns that this &amp;ldquo;virtual water trading&amp;rdquo; is unsustainable in the long term, especially in drought-plagued areas such as California. If California is &lt;em>really&lt;/em> short of water, why are we shipping it to Asia?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What this means is, ultimately, the US is not in control of its own farmland &amp;ndash; or food production.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPEN0o5pbA4" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Some argue the Imperial Valley is doing good by growing food and feeding the country, and point the finger at some desert metropolises such as Las Vegas, which boasts some 50 million visitors each year and wastes way more &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-01-29/colorado-river-in-crisis-cracking-down-on-grass">water from Colorado River&lt;/a> with its gushing fountains. The truth is, Las Vegas and Reno represent 95% of Nevada&amp;rsquo;s economy but use 10% of its water &amp;ndash; alfalfa growers use most of the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Water overuse is a prisoner&amp;rsquo;s dilemma and a tragedy of the commons. If free-market mechanisms &amp;ndash; which much of western ag publicly applauds and privately abhors &amp;ndash; were actually allowed to work, the West&amp;rsquo;s water &amp;ldquo;shortage&amp;rdquo; would be exposed for what it is: the sort of shortage you expect when inexhaustible demand chases an almost free good. (If someone were selling Porsches for $3,000 apiece, there would be a shortage of those, too.) California has a shortage of water because it has a surfeit of cows &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s really almost as simple as that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If history is any guide, the odds that we can sustain a &amp;ldquo;civilization&amp;rdquo; in deserts would have to be regarded as low. Only one desert civilization, out of dozens that grew up in antiquity, has survived uninterrupted into modern times. And Egypt&amp;rsquo;s approach to irrigation was fundamentally different from all the rest.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It just struck me that I should make a &lt;em>pane ricco&lt;/em> (rich bread). I named it as such because in the western US, it&amp;rsquo;s often said that water flows uphill toward money. And it literally does. Water leaps 3,000 feet across the Tehachapi Mountains in gigantic siphons to slay the thirst of Los Angeles, as it&amp;rsquo;s shoved 1,000 feet out of Colorado River canyons to hydrate Phoenix and Palm Springs and the irrigated lands around them. Water is wealth in the West.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I baked the bread on a BBQ grill (again!).&lt;/p>

Soft like a brioche, chewy like a pasta.</description><content>&lt;p>&lt;em>This is part 6 of my &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/california-grain-adventure/">California Grain Adventure&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few years ago I drove through Tucson, Arizona with a friend. We stopped by an unbelievably highly rated artisan bakery in town and tried a few different kinds of their bread (some loaves contained a small percentage of locally grown &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/white-sonora/">White Sonora&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/desert-gold-durum/">Desert Durum&lt;/a>). Each single one of these breads we got tasted like burnt toast. A big question mark popped into my head: Do professional bakers not know that they can score bread with beautiful designs &lt;em>without&lt;/em> burning it and making it so bitter, so hard to bite through the crust, and so tough to eat? I was more than disappointed because of all the hype. Literally every loaf needed to come out 10 minutes sooner. Luckily, the interior was decent enough to be edible; not great, still better than all the other bakeries in Tucson combined, which says a lot about bread culture in Tucson &amp;ndash; heck, city is better known for flour tortillas than levain. I swore next time I&amp;rsquo;d skip Tucson and check out some &lt;em>panaderías&lt;/em> in Sonora, Mexico instead. &amp;ldquo;Artisan&amp;rdquo; is one of the most used/abused words today; it just means &amp;ldquo;we are new to this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We kept on going along I-8 E towards San Diego. Soon after we crossed the Arizona-California state border, we passed the Imperial Valley, a sprawling patch in the Sonoran Desert, hemmed in by the Salton Sea to the north and Mexico to the south.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I probably would haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about the place again if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the Desert Durum® wheat.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/california-dreamin-6/20230318_173853.jpg"
alt="pane nero with Desert Gold durum"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>handmade Desert Gold durum &lt;em>pane nero&lt;/em>: 100% wholegrain Desert Gold durum flour at 140% hydration, leavened with sourdough, flavored with nutty tahini, and coated in black sesame seeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Today the Imperial Valley produces more than half of the durum in California. Durum used to grown mainly in Siskiyou and Modoc Counties in the northernmost part of the state, until a few decades ago, when durum production moved to the southernmost part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Durum (&lt;em>Triticum turgidum, spp. Durum&lt;/em>) is an ancient variety of hard red spring wheat, a close relative of ancient emmer that is exceptionally hard &amp;ndash; hence the name &amp;ldquo;durum,&amp;rdquo; which is Latin for &amp;ldquo;hard,&amp;rdquo; and the species is the hardest of all wheats. As such, it requires significant force to mill into sandy-textured, golden-colored semolina for pasta and more finely ground durum flour for breads and pastries. Coupled with a high protein content (typically &amp;gt;12%), durum is a miller&amp;rsquo;s delight (or challenge).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Durum is genetically less evolved than the modern bread wheat (&lt;em>Triticum aestivum&lt;/em>), but stands out among other wheat varieties with its unique characteristics. Most of the durum grown today is amber durum; the grains are larger than other types of wheat berries, and have a beautiful amber color due to the extra carotenoid pigments (the naturally occurring compounds that give red, orange, and yellow vegetables their vibrant color), which also contribute to its distinct flavor that can be described as nuttier and slightly sweeter than modern wheat.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/california-dreamin-6/desert-durum-berries.jpg"
alt="Desert Gold durum wheat berries"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Desert Gold durum wheat berries, from the Imperial Valley of California. Durum wheat berries are the source of the semolina flour used to make one of the food staples of the world &amp;ndash; pasta &amp;ndash; as well as other traditional delicacies such as couscous and bulgur.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Durum has a yellow endosperm, which gives pasta its distinct color. When durum is initially milled, the endosperm is ground into a granular product called &lt;em>semolina&lt;/em>, which has a texture more like cornmeal and is ideal for pasta. Typically, the endosperm is separated from the bran and germ of the grain; only the endosperm is milled. It&amp;rsquo;s also possible to keep all the components, resulting in a wholegrain durum semolina.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have ever tried making Jeff Hamelman&amp;rsquo;s durum bread from his &lt;em>Bread&lt;/em>, you may have tripped over &amp;ldquo;durum flour.&amp;rdquo; This usually refers to very finely milled durum flour, aka. &lt;em>semola rimacinata&lt;/em> (remilled semolina, sometimes labeled &amp;ldquo;extra fancy&amp;rdquo; durum flour). After separating coarse durum midds, the semolina flour is re-milled several times until it resembles a fine powder. It&amp;rsquo;s the finest grind possible for durum and has the palest color, though it still looks yellow due to durum&amp;rsquo;s high carotenoid pigment concentration. Durum flour is great for softer-type noodles and some types of artisan bread that don&amp;rsquo;t require the elasticity of a high-rising flour. Again, durum flour can either be refined or wholegrain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite its relatively high protein content, durum&amp;rsquo;s gluten quality is different from that of modern bread wheat. While it forms a relatively stretchy dough, the dough structure tends to be fragile and weak, easily breaking down if mixed too much or fermented for too long. As such, breads made with mostly semolina or durum flours tend to have a dense and chewy texture. In some parts of the world, such as Altamura, Italy, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->durum breads&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> are beloved for that specific texture as well as distinct flavor.&lt;/p>

alt="Desert Gold durum ravioli"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>handmade wholegrain Desert Gold durum sourdough ravioli, stuffed with mozzarella, fresh basil leaves, and parmigiano-reggiano&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>So why is durum so prized for pasta-making?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Texture&lt;/strong>: The main reason is the gluten in durum is strong but not particularly elastic, which means pasta made from this type of flour will keep its shape and the cherished &lt;em>al dente&lt;/em> texture after cooking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Taste&lt;/strong>: Durum has a delicious nutty flavor with an earthy aroma.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Aesthetics&lt;/strong>: Durum has a rich golden color, which naturally evokes a happy feeling about the quality of the pasta and meals made with it. High-quality pasta awakens all the senses &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s an immersive experience to be savored.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>California is recognized for growing the best durum in the world. California durum varieties tend to have high yellow pigment, high gluten strength, and make a perfect &lt;em>al dente&lt;/em> whole-wheat pasta.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have ever enjoyed Barilla pasta in your favorite Italian dish, you have most likely consumed Desert Durum® wheat from Imperial County, CA. The Imperial Valley is the main location for the production of the Desert Durum®, a special type of durum with excellent quality that is highly demanded by various local and international pasta makers like Barilla Pasta. The success of the Desert Durum® wheat is owed to the hard work of UC-Davis professor and researcher, Jorge Dubcovsky.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="Desert Gold durum ravioli sauced"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>handmade wholegrain Desert Gold durum sourdough ravioli, cooked and served with creamy sun-dried tomato sauce, shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano, and fresh basil&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Desert Gold is a Desert Durum® variety with high-yield potential and excellent pasta quality; it&amp;rsquo;s also well adapted to the San Joaquin Valley and the Imperial Valley of California. It&amp;rsquo;s very similar to Desert King, but has two genes for improved yellow pigment in pasta and one gene for reduced grain cadmium content (a beneficial human health trait).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be labeled as Desert Durum® commercially, the grain must be at least 90% produced under irrigation in the desert valleys and lowland of Arizona or California. These are areas of high temperatures (May-June temperatures average 90°F) and low rainfall (annual precipitation averages less than 200 mm). Desert Durum® is planted November through February and harvested in May and June.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="milling">milling&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Most of the durum produced (under irrigation) in the desert valleys and lowlands of Arizona and California are rated &lt;strong>No. 1 Hard Amber Durum (HAD)&lt;/strong>, a subclass of durum under the Official US Standards for Grain. HAD has &amp;gt;=75% hard, vitreous kernels of amber color, and sets the &amp;ldquo;gold standard&amp;rdquo; for premium pasta, couscous, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/california-dreamin-6/desert-durum-joaquin.jpg"
alt="Desert Gold durum vs. Joaquin Oro"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Desert Gold durum (left) vs. Joaquin Oro (right), both grown in California.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The vitreousness of durum wheat has traditionally been regarded by the wheat industry worldwide as an important quality factor. The average vitreous kernel content (HVAC) of Desert Durum® is &amp;gt;=90%. When compared to non-vitreous (starchy and piebald) kernels, vitreous kernels generally have improved cooking quality, better pasta color, coarser granulation, and higher protein content &amp;ndash; and thus sell at a premium. That comes with a string attached, of course: The glassy and translucent vitreous kernels are significantly harder to mill than the opaque starchy kernels, which are as hard as common bread wheats. (Piebald kernels are intermediate in protein content, but comparable in hardness to vitreous kernels.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never milled durum before, but I&amp;rsquo;ve often heard that durum milling is a complex procedure involving repetitive grinding and sieving, in order to obtain maximal semolina yield and the least amount of bran powder. Since the durum endosperm is extremely hard and vitreous, millers usually peel or pearl the kernels first to remove the outer layers of bran, to help improve the efficiency of durum processing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These Desert Gold durum berries shared by friends at the California Wheat Commission were super easy to mill. I ran them through a countertop electric WonderMill only once (on Bread Flour setting), and it turned out fine enough for my use.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="Desert Gold durum flour"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Freshly milled Desert Gold durum, unsifted. It smells nutty and toasty, like roasted chickpeas!&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I guess this first grind would be called &lt;em>semola di grano duro integrale&lt;/em> in Italy. The texture is somewhat gritty, less coarse than typical semolina but not as fine as flour. It has an amber yellow color and contains every part of the grain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OMG, freshly milled Desert Gold durum has such an intoxicating aroma, reminiscent of roasted chickpeas!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pane-nero">&lt;em>pane nero&lt;/em>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is my first durum bake in a looooong time. I made a loaf of 100% semolina sourdough bread ~3 years ago, and used semolina (&lt;em>rava&lt;/em>/&lt;em>suji&lt;/em>) from an Indian grocery store. That experiment gave me a good idea of how durum/semolina would behave in a bread dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time, I set my sight on delving into the flavorful versatility of durum. I would like to find out what makes whole durum wheat tick from both a milling and baking standpoint and how I might incorporate it into my freshly milled wholegrain repertoire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get the best flavor out of durum, you have to to push the limits. In my experience with durum, a long autolyse helps develop the dough; a ripe levain makes a better bread; after which, all it needs is a quick shape and bake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The conventional rules of thumb for baking with durum/semolina is 1) low hydration and 2) gentle mixing. For example, &lt;em>pane di Altamura&lt;/em> usually comes in at 65%-70% hydration and &lt;em>pane di Matera&lt;/em> at 70%-80%.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly keen on sticking to tried-and-true methods. I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and bake my interpretation of &lt;em>pane nero&lt;/em> (black bread from Sicily).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this bread:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>total Desert Gold durum milled: &lt;strong>400g&lt;/strong> (100%)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>total hydration: &lt;strong>560g&lt;/strong> (140%)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Using the same fine-mesh sieve that I used to bolt Turkey Red, I bolted 400g freshly milled wholegrain durum flour into&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>360g flour (90% extraction)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>40g coarse bits (10%)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s pretty high extraction for the first run through the mill.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="semolina-porridge">semolina porridge&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Given that the bran of the durum wheat kernel is actually thinner than most hard wheats &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s the starchy endosperm that&amp;rsquo;s actually the hardest to shatter &amp;ndash; the bigger pieces in wholegrain durum flour don&amp;rsquo;t always end up being mostly bran.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pre-cooking the coarse pieces will help bring out the wonderful flavors and nutrition benefits of the bran and the germ &amp;ndash; aromatic oils, minerals, and fiber, to name a few.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>

&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>

&lt;td>100%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>40g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>whole milk&lt;/td>
&lt;td>300%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>120g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Process:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Toast the dry semolina mix in a 300°F oven (or in a skillet on the stovetop) for 3-4 minutes, until a slight toasty aroma hits your nose. This step is optional but will enhance the flavor enormously. Just be careful not to go overboard &amp;ndash; it will burn in a flash.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Put the toasties in a small pot and pour in milk; bring to a full boil, whisking frequently.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Reduce heat and simmer until a thick, creamy consistency. Turn off heat and let it cool off.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The semolina mix cooks fast &amp;ndash; the whole thing takes 10-15 minutes tops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You can make this in a microwave, too, just make sure to pause and stir frequently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any kind of milk will work. You can use plain water, too.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The porridge will also improve the texture of the baked bread through a process called &lt;em>starch gelatinization&lt;/em>, where starch and water meet heat, causing the starch molecules to swell. As a result, the water is gradually absorbed in an irreversible manner (&amp;ldquo;locked in&amp;rdquo;). This turns the mixture into a viscous and transparent gel, which is then used in sauces, puddings, creams and other food products to provide a pleasing texture. One of the most recognizable Chinese &lt;em>dim sum&lt;/em> delicacies, &lt;a href="https://tasteasianfood.com/har-gow/">&lt;em>har gow&lt;/em>&lt;/a> (shrimp dumplings), utilizes this technique to create an ultra-thin, translucent, and chewy skin. (The most common example to explain this phenomenon is pasta preparation: Pasta is made ​​mostly of semolina that contains high amounts of starch; when it&amp;rsquo;s cooked in boiling water, the size increases because it absorbs water and gets a soft texture.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I built the &lt;em>lievito madre&lt;/em> (20g sourdough starter + 40g water + 80g wholegrain durum flour) 8 hours before making the final dough, refreshing it every 3 hours or so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also toasted 1/2 of the black sesame seeds, leaving the other 1/2 raw for coating the dough.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Process:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Autolyse&lt;/strong> @ ~70% hydration: Combine the flour with 252g water; mix until a shaggy mass; let autolyze for 6-8 hours (or overnight) in the fridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Levain&lt;/strong>: Squeeze the levain into the dough; mix until combined; let rest for 10-20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Double hydration&lt;/strong>: Add 100g or 2/3 of the remaining water gradually, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgz0oAhgwyg">Rubaud-mixing&lt;/a> (lifting, stretching, and dropping) until thoroughly absorbed. This requires a bit patience, so take your time. If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I&amp;rsquo;m good at, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>bassinage&lt;/em>. And I usually put on some &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlQWGGham__4sBxnwVyKbM8n91Xb9vwUG">music&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkB8eF4ATHl4Jm1BeCZgQ9A">podcasts&lt;/a> while I do this. Hand-mixing a dough is a type of alternative physical therapy; I find it tremendously therapeutic and cathartic. Gorging the dough with soooo much water feels like a crime, TBH. I keep going until the dough tells me to stop&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Salt&lt;/strong>: Mix in the salt. Then let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Semolina porridge&lt;/strong>: Divide the porridge into 3-4 portions; spread over the dough one portion at a time; mix until evenly distributed. With the porridge added back, no part of the grain is removed. Let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Triple hydration&lt;/strong>: Add the rest of the water, Rubaud-mixing until completely incorporated. Let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Tahini&lt;/strong>: Drizzle in the tahini, Rubaud-mixing until entirely combined.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cold ferment&lt;/strong>: Transfer the dough to a fridge (or somewhere 38°F-43°F) right away and ferment for 24 hours; take it out every few hours and perform a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JQm2n4aVZc">coil-fold&lt;/a> with a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds. I did 4 folds in total and folded in all of the toasted sesame seeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Shape &amp;amp; final proof&lt;/strong>: After 24 hours of bulk fermentation (~85% volume increase), shape the dough into whatever form you want. Roll it in the rest of black sesame seeds. Let it warm up to room temperature for 2-3 hours before baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The dough had a subtle toasty aroma, and surprised me with its softness and ease of handling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Artisanal boules look visually stunning, but are a &lt;em>de facto&lt;/em> pain in the butt to slice and freeze. Since I&amp;rsquo;m more pragmatic than artistic, I prefer the humble shape of a sandwich loaf &amp;ndash; much more space-efficient in the freezer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I shaped the dough into a log, proofed it seam-side up in a wide loaf pan, and baked with no scoring/slashing. The bread cracked open all on its own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind I baked this bread in my countertop toaster oven. It probably comes out prettier and crustier in a better oven with some fancy steaming apparatus &amp;ndash; or even a wood-fired oven.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The crumb has a marvelous golden color, light texture with a natural nutty flavor. Great to enjoy with with cheese and a glass of red wine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first glance, the crumb doesn&amp;rsquo;t look open because air holes are really tiny, but the softness is extreme because the increase in volume was incredible.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>With a long fermentation and crispy aromatic sesame seeds (toasted during baking) on the outside, you get an irresistible bread that gives you the distinct flavors of the whole durum wheat, the chew from the hardness of this wheat (after all, it&amp;rsquo;s the wheat of choice for pasta), and its wonderful infusion with the toasted sesame seeds.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The crust is so thin and soft that it would be non-existent if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the sesame seeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each slice feels light, soft, and springy in my hand. It tastes soft like a brioche, chewy like a pasta; exceptionally smooth, custardy, and creamy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The flavor is subtly sweet, reminiscent of pasta, and does not taste like whole wheat at all. There is a hint of saltiness and tanginess.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Most of the &lt;em>pani puglisi&lt;/em> I have eaten in Italy have those characteristics: a high percentage of fine durum wheat, an light crumb with irregular holes, a very chewy texture, and a long keeping time (days and days).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The semolina porridge contributes a cotton-like softness to the crumb. As an extra perk, it improved the bread&amp;rsquo;s keeping quality (after it&amp;rsquo;s first sliced). During baking, the porridge releases water slowly, resulting in a continuous softening of both the crumb and the crust.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>How does this 100% whole durum bread compare to the semolina breads I made before? For starters, I could smell the difference during baking. Both had wonderful aromas, but the 100% whole durum version had a strikingly richer and more vibrant aroma that I didn&amp;rsquo;t recall from the semolina. On the inside, this wholesome version has a slightly juicier and softer crumb with a richer hue of yellow, thanks to the gorgeous load of the freshly milled wholegrain durum flour. Now, you can simply taste more of the grain &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s sweeter, nuttier, and to me, more satisfying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The durum bread is a perfect example of how you can take an already great grain &amp;ndash; especially freshly milled &amp;ndash; to the next level. hence the bread&amp;rsquo;s golden color &amp;ndash; it is a combination of coarsely milled semolina and finely milled durum flours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried a slice of this bread dipped in olive oil with a little balsamic vinegar. That was spectacular! The magical combination of flavors was delightful. I thought about using this bread in other characteristic Italian ways &amp;ndash; as garlic bread, toasted and smeared with almond butter, or eaten with a hearty &lt;em>ribollito&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; but didn&amp;rsquo;t get that far. The bread was gone in 2 days.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>If there is one bread that I wish everyone could taste to see how wonderful a freshly milled wholegrain bread can be, this may be it: Light, fluffy, and soft in texture, with an airy crumb; the rich, nutty, sweet durum flavor shines right through; and the crunch of the sesame seeds on the exterior offers a pleasing contrast against the tenderness of the interior.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Californians invented the concept of life-style. This alone warrants their doom.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Don DeLillo, &lt;em>White Noise&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Virginia Postrel&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em>The Power of Glamour&lt;/em>, highlights California as a particularly glamorous icon. It has always attracted some of the most ambitious, gifted, and can-do people in the world. But for all the innovations of Silicon Valley and Hollywood, northern California&amp;rsquo;s NIMBYism is paradoxically antithetical to a culture that embraces change and risk. The local governments don&amp;rsquo;t seem so can-do, either. Longtime residents and Uber drivers are eager to tell you how their city &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/26/opinion/san-francisco-democrats-board-of-supervisors.html">isn&amp;rsquo;t what it once was&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite all the media blitz, maybe Silicon Valley is imprinted with more of the East Coast finance culture than the techies would like to admit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Friday (10 March 2023), the 16th largest commercial bank in the US, a S&amp;amp;P 500 component, and $209 billion in assets got &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/silicon-valley-bank-sivb-stock-fdic-cbs-explains/">wiped out&lt;/a> overnight.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>California regulators on Friday abruptly shuttered Silicon Valley Bank, closing a 40-year-old financial institution that catered to the tech industry and that was the 16th largest U.S. bank before its sudden collapse. The company&amp;rsquo;s stock tumbled 60% on Thursday and had plunged another 70% on Friday before trading of its shares was halted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nosedive reflected fears of a bank run, concerns that materialized as depositors &amp;ndash; mostly technology company workers and venture capital-backed companies &amp;ndash; rushed to withdraw money this week as anxiety over the bank&amp;rsquo;s balance sheet spread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regulators stepped in to take control, with the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closing the bank and appointing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. It&amp;rsquo;s the largest failure of a financial institution since Washington Mutual in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis more than a decade ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Two things were happening on Wall Street this weekend: Junior analysts were watching &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038650/">It&amp;rsquo;s a Wonderful Life&lt;/a>&lt;/em> to see what a good old-fashioned bank run looks like; mid-level analysts were hammering the F9 key to see what higher &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp">weighted average cost of capital&lt;/a> (WACC) was doing to valuations.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Nearly every major US bank has mark-to-market losses on its held-to-maturity (HTM) Treasury bond portfolio. For Wells Fargo, it&amp;rsquo;s ~20%. For Bank of America, it&amp;rsquo;s closer to 40%. For Silicon Valley Bank, those losses exceeded total equity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SVB is a unique outlier &amp;ndash; it made terrible decisions that were several orders of magnitude worse than other banks. The truly unique feature of SVB was its deposit profile, instead of its investment profile. Because SVB was not a retail bank, but rather a corporate bank focused on serving startups and VCs, the vast majority of its deposit accounts were corporate in nature and well above the FDIC-insured limits of $250k. (If that sounds like an extreme amount to you, then you don&amp;rsquo;t realize America is inundated with millionaires and billionaires &amp;ndash; thanks to their real estate holdings, if nothing else. SVB had almost no insured deposits. It was literally a bank for millionaires and billionaires, who are called &amp;ldquo;oligarchs&amp;rdquo; in Russia.) As news began to percolate that SVB was raising equity capital to offset losses in a HTM portfolio, VCs and startups scampered away at the first sign of trouble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Risk happens slowly, then all at once. Deposit outflows from SVB likely hit full stride on Friday, with Peter Thiel&amp;rsquo;s Founders Fund calling for VCs to pull their money out. Nothing like biting the hand that feeds you. Nowadays one tweet is all it takes to trigger a &amp;ldquo;bank run.&amp;rdquo; On Saturday, desperate customers &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11849049/Customers-line-outside-Republic-Bank-money-SVB-bank-collapsed.html">lined up outside First Republic Bank&lt;/a> in southern California to take their money out.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Saturday that he&amp;rsquo;s talking with the White House to help &amp;ldquo;stabilize the situation as quickly as possible, to protect jobs, people&amp;rsquo;s livelihoods, and the entire innovation ecosystem that has served as a &lt;em>tent pole&lt;/em> for our economy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A &lt;em>tent pole&lt;/em> is a fragile skeleton. If it breaks, your tent may wobble, flap or completely collapse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To anyone who works in or follows tech, SVB is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> &amp;ldquo;a little-known California bank&amp;rdquo; as portrayed by East Coast mainstream media. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>the go-to bank&lt;/em> for US tech startups &amp;ndash; it provided funding to &lt;a href="https://www.svb.com/venture-funded">44%&lt;/a> of all VC-backed tech and healthcare companies that publicly listed on a stock exchange last year.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">In a deep sense — though not a legal sense — what SVB actually did was a kind of affinity fraud a la Madoff. It managed to convince the VC/startup/crypto etc world that it was one of them, part of their community, and hence trustworthy 5/&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1634911360227201025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 12, 2023&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>And when it comes to money, people aren&amp;rsquo;t concerned with getting Covid&amp;hellip; FWIW, yesterday marked the 3-year anniversary of the official declaration of the &amp;ldquo;COVID-19 Pandemic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sophisticated investors, those with far in excess of $250k and saw the writing on the wall ahead of the crowd, began pulling their money from SVB weeks ago. Which means the bank had to have the cash to pay them. Which means the bank had to sell assets to raise the cash. And if the assets are long-duration bonds with rising yields, they had to be liquidated at a loss. SVB lost ~$2 billion trying to meet withdrawals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it still wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough. The bank collapsed. The government took it over. Which means if you had &amp;lt;$250k in your account, you are good. If you had more&amp;hellip;you get a piece of paper saying you will hopefully get 100% back, but it depends on the liquidation of the bank. During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, with IndyMac, you got 50 cents on the dollar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s why people were rushing to those non-diversified banks like First Republic to get their money out ASAP.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When the tide goes out, you find out who is swimming naked.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Bill.com had to come out and assure investors that its banking relationship with SVB is easily replaceable. Roku held ~$487 million, or ~26%, of its $1.9 billion cash and cash equivalents at SVB, and most of its deposits with the bank are &lt;em>uninsured&lt;/em>. Toronto-based AcuityAds Holding held &amp;gt;90% of its deposits (USD $55 million) in SVB. BlockFi also had $227 million with SVB, but it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>not FDIC-insured&lt;/em> because it was in a money market mutual fund. Business continuity concerns are high for many companies exposed to SVB, which will cause reverberations across sectors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of analogies to Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) and even Bear Stearns are being made. If SVB wants to have a chance to be remembered as &amp;ldquo;fondly&amp;rdquo; as those, it will take more than a 2-day SPX decline of 3.3%. No movie is made about little blips.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">The failure of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SVB_Financial?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SVB_Financial&lt;/a> could destroy an important long-term driver of the economy as VC-backed companies rely on SVB for loans and holding their operating cash. If private capital can’t provide a solution, a highly dilutive gov’t preferred bailout should be considered.&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1634028534107602944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2023&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Is SVB as important to the national financial plumbing as Bank of America? Not even close. Is this another Lehman or Bear Stearns? Absolutely not. But still, to think this massive banking entity exists in a vacuum with no implications for the rest of the economy is naive. There will be ripple effects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The odds of your local bank failing, which is probably a national bank anyway, are low, but once consumer &lt;em>con&lt;/em>fidence fades&amp;hellip;you have no idea what might happen. Western banks and financial markets are already fragile, and psychology is fracturing. Pile on deteriorating asset quality from emerging markets and toxic CRE exposures&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can&amp;rsquo;t count on anyone but yourself these days. And be wary of listening to your friends or people you run into. Most people are not sophisticated, and full of sh*t anyway. They want to make themselves look good; some are &lt;em>con&lt;/em>fident salesmen&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We live in an information economy, which means those with the most information win. It&amp;rsquo;s true in each and every business. After all, the executives at SVB got paid, as always. As for the depositors&amp;hellip;the savvy ones with the most information got their money out. The rest?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Silicon Valley appears to be great at massive differential equations, but has difficulty balancing a check book. Probably because they do not know what a check book is.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">How financially innumerate is Silicon Valley…?!

Shouldn’t that be enough for one payroll? &lt;a href="https://t.co/3VJxuXPvbi">https://t.co/3VJxuXPvbi&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Diogenes (@WallStCynic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WallStCynic/status/1634948491704434688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 12, 2023&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>Now the biggest question: Is the SVB failure another isolated / non-systemic / contained event?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>History is the poet that loves to rhyme. FTX was the spark that lit the fuse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>~24 hours earlier, Silvergate Bank, a cornerstone in the crypto world, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23631320/silvergate-wind-down-liquidiation-announcement">announced it would shut down&lt;/a> &amp;ldquo;in light of recent industry and regulatory developments.&amp;rdquo; Signature Bank, another key crypto bank with more than $110 billion in assets, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/new-york-state-regulators-close-signature-bank-2023-03-12/">crashed this morning&lt;/a>. The second &lt;em>and&lt;/em> third largest bank failures in US history, after Washington Mutual in 2008, happened in the span of 48 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bank liquidity is front and center, and mark-to-market shenanigans are leaving a capital crater. SVB has many valuable assets (people/relationships) that got caught in a classic bank run (using short-term financing to buy long-term assets). EVERYTHING hinges on what the regulators decide this weekend. My prediction is the Fed opens the discount window for all assets to provide short-term financing for all FDIC banks. Some entity will buy the carcass of SVB. (12 months ago, every banker wanted this bank. That&amp;rsquo;s still the case and SVB is now 75% off.)

&lt;p>Once again, it&amp;rsquo;s not just SVB, it&amp;rsquo;s the system that is being examined. A month ago, Brookfield Corp., parent of the largest office landlord in downtown Los Angeles, &lt;a href="https://archive.is/v4Ike">defaulted&lt;/a> on two office towers in DTLA. The news was ignored. Why are major asset players defaulting on mortgages on CRE? Negative carry. Raising capital at 7% to finance a 4% cap rate building is a losing trade. Brookfield is one of many entities that has levered up their CRE to pay their owners and buy other assets. This plan worked well in a 0% interest rate world, but not so much in the current environment. The question is, who owns the mortgages on these and many other half-filled CRE? Pension funds? Private equity? Insurance companies? Regional Banks? Wall Street? Time will tell. Economic iceberg dead ahead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bank runs, like war, are big business for the establishment. Never let a crisis go to waste.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What created California, economically and politically, was actually constant support from the eastern web of American society, industry, and, especially, the federal government. The sheer geographical isolation of different parts of the state tends to obscure the elementary fact of its interrelatedness. The refusal to acknowledge this public interrelatedness, to insist on the determining value of the personal, the private, and the exceptional, has been California&amp;rsquo;s fragmenting delusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This assertion that California is a stronghold of urbanity and groundedness is contrary, even petulant. The national narrative of the West Coast &amp;ndash; what goes on there, what it means &amp;ndash; has been fashioned by editors and emissaries from the East Coast. But, where the East Coast press had decided that California once stood for futurism, beaches, lush life, and togetherness, now you find a California full of dusty houses, arid inland landscapes, fires and blackouts, dotcom bust 2.0, and social alienation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I keep coming back to the San Joaquin Valley-grown Sonora Blanca. The wheat&amp;rsquo;s unique terroir and wonderful flavor profile linger in my mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more I use it, the more special this wheat feels to me. Each kernel holds a universe of long-forgotten flavors. I think too many people are afraid to try new things with Sonora because of its commercial classification as a &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; wheat, which is sad. Sonora has soooo much potential &amp;ndash; yet to be discovered. I&amp;rsquo;d use it for everything. &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/california-dreamin-3">Wholegrain Sonora cookies&lt;/a> turned out absolutely scrumptious, and &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/california-dreamin-4">wholegrain &lt;em>pan de sonora&lt;/em>&lt;/a> was equally delectable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Baking, in my mind, is one of those &amp;ldquo;low-stakes&amp;rdquo; activities that require significantly less risk-taking than, say, starting a company. If it takes this much guts for bakers to try a new flour, then there&amp;rsquo;s no hope for this country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember someone once told me the closest they got to winning the Hunger Games was when they spotted the last donut in the office kitchen. So I decided to make some wholegrain sourdough &lt;em>bomboloni&lt;/em> (Italian-style donuts).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/california-dreamin-3">mentioned&lt;/a> a few weeks ago, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been using eggs due to the ongoing egg shortage. Feel free to use eggs instead of milk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kabocha is a squat and round hard squash with a dull green rind, but the inside hidden beneath that unassuming exterior is sweet, nutty, and delightfully starchy. The flavor of kabocha is a mix of sweet potato and pumpkin; the texture is drier and airier than butternut squash, which makes it perfect for &lt;a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/kabocha-tempura-recipe-2031602">tempura&lt;/a>. Roasting kabocha is one of my favorite ways to enjoy it. Simply, cut kabocha into wedges, toss with some olive oil, and roast in a 400°F oven until tender and caramelized, about 25-30 minutes, to concentrate the squash&amp;rsquo;s texture and flavor. If you can&amp;rsquo;t find kabocha, substitute with 1/2 sweet potato and 1/2 hard winter squash (delicata, butternut, acorn, calabaza, Seminole, etc).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Here goes the zen and the art of making soft and fluffy &lt;em>bomboloni&lt;/em>, which very much reminds me of making &lt;em>panettoni&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Mix everything together into a stiff dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Bulk ferment at 75°F for 6 hours. Fold once every 30 mins, 4 times in total.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Retard in the fridge for 12 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Divide into 10 pieces (~60g each), and shape into taut balls.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Proof at 73°F for 12 hours until tripled in size.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Heat a pot of coconut oil to 350°F-360°F; fry ~5 minutes on each side. You want both sides to be brown and crispy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Remove from oil and let dry on a wire rack lined with paper towels.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once cool (but still warm), coat in homemade cinnamon sugar. Fill with &lt;em>crema pasticciera&lt;/em>, if desired. They are delicious without filling, IMO.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>Typically, you need a strong bread flour to make these &lt;em>bomboloni&lt;/em>, but I&amp;rsquo;m quite surprised &amp;ndash; and pleased &amp;ndash; with how well these Sonora Blanca &lt;em>bomboloni integrali&lt;/em> have turned out!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The extended fermentation time give these &lt;em>bomboloni&lt;/em> a super fluffy, airy texture &amp;ndash; you won&amp;rsquo;t know it&amp;rsquo;s whole wheat!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Bomboloni&lt;/em> literally translates as &amp;ldquo;big bombs&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; a perfect name for these big round donuts and an apt moniker for the current era.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Every time I fly west, following the sun, I experience a lightening of spirit as the land below opens up, the checkerboards of the Midwestern plains giving way to the vast empty reach between the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If I were to pick the time when I should travel in California, it would be in the early summer. All the rest of the world at that moment is green. California alone is sheer gold. &amp;hellip; On one side the Pacific &amp;ndash; tigerish, calm, powerfully palpitant, stretching into eternity in enormous bronze-gold, foam-laced planes. On the other side, great, bare, voluptuously-contoured hills, running parallel with the train and winding serpentinely on for hours and hours of express speed; hills that look, not as though they were covered with yellow grass, but as though they were carved from massy gold. At intervals come ravines filled with a heavy green growth. Occasionally on those golden hill-surfaces appear trees.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Inez Haynes Irwin, &lt;em>The Californiacs&lt;/em> (1919)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>My favorite road in California lies between Interstate 5 and Monterrey. I used to drive along &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_152">Route 152&lt;/a>, on the way from San Francisco to southern California, a dozen times a year. The land lies smoothly in carpets of green during the summer, then golds and browns for the rest of the year. Commanding it all are the oak trees spotting the hills. Today this part is still mostly clear of development and hasn&amp;rsquo;t been overrun by greed or ambition.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s actually kind of odd, now that I think about it. I was initially drawn to California because of its Silicon Valley &amp;ndash; I went to work in tech, and realized the tech scene there was a shadow of its former dotcom self; the real innovation was in finding new ways to scam investors and keeping the ball rolling. California&amp;rsquo;s natural beauty was just one of &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->accidental perks&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> that I discovered along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember going to a California Impressionist art collection a few years ago in Irvine, a master-planned city in Orange County, southern California. The Irvine Museum was located in a peculiar place &amp;ndash; on the bottom floor of a high-rise office building in Irvine&amp;rsquo;s Financial District, a short walk from UC-Irvine campus and John Wayne Airport. The office building housed the usual white-collar businesses like law firms and travel agencies; the space occupied by the &amp;ldquo;museum&amp;rdquo; had a mundane corporate feel, and could just as easily house a dozen cubicles filled with telemarketers cold-calling people on adjustable-rate mortgages. It was actually more of a gallery &amp;ndash; and not a very big one at that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I later found out the building was originally a McDonnell Douglas Building and the museum, which used to be on the 12th floor, was &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-04-15-ca-248-story.html">established&lt;/a> by descendants of James Irvine who founded Irvine Ranch, the sprawling agricultural property that evolved into the City of Irvine. The Irvine family developed their ranch in the 1960s, which is to say, the city didn&amp;rsquo;t exist before then.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>James Irvine was a canny, Belfast-born opportunist who came to California seeking gold. He failed to strike it rich in the streams and hills near Sutter&amp;rsquo;s Mill, but became wealthy selling supplies to his fellow 49ers. (What&amp;rsquo;s the saying? &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t dig for gold, sell shovels!&amp;quot;) In 1864, Irvine and three other San Francisco businessmen &amp;ndash; Benjamin and Thomas Flint, and Llewellyn Bixby &amp;ndash; bought 50,000 acres of &lt;em>Rancho San Joaquín&lt;/em> from José Andrés Sepúlveda, a famed &lt;em>Californio vaquero&lt;/em> who obtained the land in 1842 through a Mexican land grant and got into a dire debt crisis due to the Great Drought of the mid-1860s. (&lt;em>Rancho San Joaquín&lt;/em> included the wind-blown marshlands on the ocean that has been developed into Newport Beach, one of California&amp;rsquo;s most elite and picturesque boating and vacation spots.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Flints and Bixby were shrewd Yankee traders (of Maine colonial stock) with a taste for adventure and wealth. They came west during the Gold Rush of 1849, returned to the east, and came back again in 1853 on two wagons driving flocks of sheep, oxen, horses, and cows. This laid the economic foundation for fortunes of Irvine, Bixby and the Flints. A few years later, the trio acquired adjacent &lt;em>El Rancho Lomas de Santiago&lt;/em> (the Ranch of the Hills of St. James) and &lt;em>Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1876, James Irvine bought out his partners for $150,000. His 110,000 acres lay on the eastern bank of the Santa Ana River, stretching 23 miles from the Santa Ana Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. He held the land intact against droughts, squatters and lawsuits by railroads. When he died in 1886, the romantic ranch land was passed on to his son, James Irvine II, who incorporated it into the Irvine Company. James Irvine II also added olive, orange, lemon and walnut trees to the prosperous sheep and cattle grazing business. 10 years before he died in 1947, he set up the James Irvine Foundation to hold 51% of the Irvine Company stock, primarily as a tax maneuver. The Irvine Company was a vestige of the sort of personal tycoonnery that made mulit-millionaires out of immigrants in the Gold Rush days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Joan Irvine Smith, the only child of James Irvine III and the great-granddaughter of the OG James Irvine, was a smart heiress. In 1957, at age 24, she replaced her mother as the major shareholder on the all-male board of the Irvine Company and the Irvine Foundation, with which she had a complicated relationship. She had seen, a good deal more clearly and realistically than what Jane Hollister Wheelwright, another descendant of one of California&amp;rsquo;s oldest ranching families, would see 4 years later: the future of the ranch, which covered 1/5 of Orange County, must not be agrarian if it were to remain under her family&amp;rsquo;s control. The rest of the Irvine board was a problem: By making small deals, selling off bits of the whole and keeping the holdings agrarian, the board was nibbling away at the family&amp;rsquo;s bread and butter. So she pressed the architect William Pereira to present a master plan. She saw the potential return in donating the land for a University of California campus, and pushed for using Irvine Company lands (a pastoral island surrounded by bustling suburbia, a freeway hop from Los Angeles) for urban development. Most importantly, she insisted on maintaining an interest in the ranch&amp;rsquo;s development. In the end, which is to say after years of internecine battles and a series of lawsuits extending three decades, she more or less prevailed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1960, before the Irvine Ranch was developed, there were 719,500 people in the whole Orange County. In 2000, there were close to 3 million, most of whom would not have been there if two families &amp;ndash; the Irvines in central Orange County, and the inheritors of Richard O&amp;rsquo;Neill&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Rancho Santa Margarita&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Mission Viejo&lt;/em> acreage in the southern &amp;ndash; had not developed their ranches.&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The California Club, which is on Flower Street in downtown Los Angeles, is still the heart of southern California&amp;rsquo;s old-money business establishment, the LA version of the Bohemian Club and Pacific Union Club in San Francisco. On any given day since World War II, virtually everyone lunching at the California Club has had a direct or indirect investment in the development of California, which is to say in the obliteration of the undeveloped California on exhibition at the Irvine Museum: rolling hills and rugged seascapes; desert and mesas and arroyos; frothy waves, mountains, and big blue sky; eucalyptus, sycamore, oak, and cottonwood; cockatoos, peacocks, and horses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>California Impressionism, of course, is a stepchild of French Impressionism, adapted with varying success to a new set of atmospheric conditions and mingled (or mangled) with various other styles. Southern Californian artists basked in broad viewer approval; they painted entirely to celebrate a golden land, sharing an Arcadian vision with fellow Californians &amp;ndash; and with tourists smitten by the fantasy of sun, surf, golden hills and distant snow-capped mountains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What struck me the most, while viewing the Irvine collection, was that it was permeated with a tenacious (or even pernicious) mood of nostalgia for the good old days, when California&amp;rsquo;s landscape was unspoiled, and yet it evidently lacked human passions. Whatever human forms you manage to make out are dwarfed by the undeveloped landscape, and some even look like indistinct Indians.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There is more nostalgia for me in these paintings than in actually going out to look at what used to be the ranch now that it has been developed, because I’m looking at what I looked at as a child.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Joan Irvine Smith&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Some of this wilderness was romantic, some washed with a slightly falsified golden light, in the tradition that runs from Albert Bierstadt&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;lustrous pearly mist&amp;rdquo; to Thomas Kinkade&amp;rsquo;s famous &amp;ldquo;glow.&amp;rdquo; Most of these paintings, however, reflect the way California looked to anyone who knew the place before the 1960s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This close representation of a familiar yet vanished landscape gives the Irvine collection its amusing effect, that of a short-term memory misfire: These paintings hang in a newly built city, Irvine (population &amp;gt;300,000, with a University of California campus enrolling some 36,000 students), that was some 60 years ago a mirror image of the paintings themselves &amp;ndash; bean fields and grazing &amp;ndash; but by no means all of the cattle and sheep operations amassed by the great-grandfather of the founder of the Irvine Museum.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Orange County&amp;rsquo;s middle-class promise didn&amp;rsquo;t pan out for all who came, but the population boom did wonders to the bottom line of the Irvine Company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The company&amp;rsquo;s commercial portfolio grew and grew with new development and upgrades. The Irvine Company-owned land in Orange County has become the country&amp;rsquo;s best-selling spot for new homes, the high-end market in particular drawing continued interest from homebuilders year on year. (Orange County is one of the most expensive counties to live in the US, with a &lt;a href="https://www.redfin.com/county/332/CA/Orange-County/housing-market">median home price of $940K&lt;/a> in January 2023; its residents include founders of Kingston, Broadcom, and Pimco.) In Orange County, the company owns large parts of the 5,000-acre Irvine Spectrum Center, Fashion Island, Newport Center, half of Irvine&amp;rsquo;s 185-acre University Research Park, Jamboree Center, MacArthur Court and the Resort at Pelican Hill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Headquartered in Newport Beach, home to some of the richest neighborhoods in the country, the privately held Irvine Company is the largest owner of offices in California and one of the two largest apartments owners in the state. Along with Orange County, San Diego and Silicon Valley, the Irvine Company has sizable holdings in Los Angeles and owns three trophy skyscrapers in Chicago. It also owns the MetLife Building at 200 Park Ave in Manhattan. The company&amp;rsquo;s holdings total ~120 million sqft, including more than 500 offices buildings and 40 retail centers, plus ~160 apartment communities with nearly 60,000 units, two golf clubs, five marinas, and three resorts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Donald Bren, the current chairman and sole shareholder of the Irvine Company, is the wealthiest person in Orange County with a net worth of ~$17 billion, ranking No.1 among US real estate executives and No.112 on the 2022 Forbes Billionaires List.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bren got his start as a homebuilder in 1958. In 1977, he joined a group of investors to acquire control of the Irvine Company. In 1983, he bought out many of his partners for $518 million and became the majority owner of the Irvine Company. In 1991, he paid &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-06-19-mn-986-story.html">$256 million&lt;/a> to heiresses Joan Irvine Smith and her mother, Athalie R. Clarke, for their shares. In 1996, he became sole owner of the Irvine Company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was with these proceeds of looking exclusively, and to a famous degree, forward that Joan Irvine Smith built her collection of &lt;em>plein air&lt;/em> art.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I can look at these paintings and look back. I can see California as it was and as we will never see it again,&amp;rdquo; she told &lt;em>Art in California&lt;/em>. Hers is an extreme example of the conundrum that to one degree or another confronts any Californian who profited from the boom years: If we could still see California as it was, how many of us could now afford to &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; it?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the spirit of Joan Irvine Smith, why don&amp;rsquo;t we look forward by forgetting what the Sonora Blanca wheat was traditionally used for and starting to explore its potential in new applications?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/california-dreamin-3">mentioned&lt;/a>, a lot of bakers shun Sonora in breadmaking by default because of its commercial classification as a &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; wheat. As a result, Sonora&amp;rsquo;s potential has been limited to tortillas, biscuits, pastries, cookies, and cakes &amp;ndash; the flat, dense stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Contrary to popular belief, my preferred application for Sonora is in sourdough breads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Making &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/desert-dynamo">a lofty loaf of bread&lt;/a> out of 100% Sonora is possible, but requires a little tango:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Diastatic malt increases the conversion of starches to sugar, boosting the Maillard reaction of the crust. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C)&amp;hellip;tightens the gluten network and gives the bread a better rise.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The resulting bread will turn out just as airy and lofty as the breads made from hard wheat &amp;ndash; and taste far more flavorful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, making bread with weak wheat inspires you to think and be creative, instead of just autopiloting &amp;ndash; or staying in your comfort zone where your unrealized dream is buried.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Baking a good loaf of bread is about knowing &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/about">who you are&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For this loaf:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>total Sonora Blanca milled: 400g (100%)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>total dough hydration: 538g (135%)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Just for fun, I hand-bolted the 400g wholegrain Sonora flour into 80% (320g) flour and 20% (80g) coarse bran &amp;amp; midds. (Midds are less coarse bits of bran and germ, plus not-so-fine flour particles).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I applied 60g of the bran &amp;amp; midds to the levain and the remaining 20g to a porridge.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Wheat midds actually contain higher levels of fiber, protein and minerals than the parent grain and have less starch and calorie. However, they are usually considered an &amp;ldquo;unwanted&amp;rdquo; by-product of the wheat flour milling industry and used as animal feed. Since I&amp;rsquo;m milling my own grains, I get to keep and enjoy all of it.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Process:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Toast the dry bran mix in a 300F oven (or in a skillet on the stovetop) for 3-4 minutes, until a slight toasty aroma hits your nose. This step is optional but will enhance the flavor enormously. Just be careful not to go overboard &amp;ndash; it will burn in a flash.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Put the bran mix in a small pot and pour in milk; bring to a full boil, whisking frequently.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Reduce heat and simmer until a thick, creamy consistency. Turn off heat and let it cool off.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The bran mix cooks fast &amp;ndash; the whole thing takes 10-15 minutes tops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You can make this in a microwave, too, just make sure to pause and stir frequently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any kind of milk will work.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This porridge is so freakin' good that you may not be able to resist eating it right out of the pot! Feel free to whip up a big pot of bran porridge either in the evening or on a quiet morning, and keep it in the fridge for a whole week of easy, nutritious breakfasts (topped with fruits, nuts, and a drizzle of honey).&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="anise-orange-water">Anise orange water&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Why use orange peels, instead of fresh orange juice, like in my &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/desert-dynamo">last Sonora loaf&lt;/a>? Well, a few reasons: I want to try something new; I have a ton of dried and frozen orange peels on hand; orange peels are flavorful, aromatic, and loaded with nutrients (wonderful additions to tea); orange peels actually contain almost twice as much vitamin C (and flavonoids) than the flesh of the fruit or the juice. In general, oranges with thicker peels tend to have more vitamin C, as the nutrient is concentrated in the peel and the white pith underneath.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Making the anise orange water is really simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Boil a handful of orange peels (fresh or dried) and a pinch of aniseeds in a pot of water for 5-10 minutes. Optional: add a stick of cinnamon and/or a few cardamom seeds and cloves for extra flavor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Turn off heat and let cool off.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Strain with a fine-mesh sieve.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stir in honey or sweetener of choice.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Mine turned out a light amber-colored, aromatic, slightly sweetish tea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also use lemon peels instead of oranges. Other substitutes include grapefruit, lime, tangerine, clementine, or citrons. You can use any fruit or vegetable that has high quantity of vitamin C. If all fails, use a tablespoon of lemon juice or rosewater.&lt;/p>

&lt;td>32g&lt;/td>

&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Dough process:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Autolyse @ ~70% hydration&lt;/em>: Mix the flour with malt; stir in 1/2 of the anise orange water; mix until a shaggy mass; let autolyze for 30 minutes in the fridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Levain&lt;/em>: Squeeze in the levain; mix until combined. Let rest for 10-20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Double hydration&lt;/em>: Add 90% of the remaining anise orange water gradually, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgz0oAhgwyg">Rubaud-mixing&lt;/a> (lifting, stretching, and dropping) until thoroughly absorbed. This requires a bit patience, so take your time. If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I&amp;rsquo;m good at, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>bassinage&lt;/em>. And I usually put on some &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlQWGGham__4sBxnwVyKbM8n91Xb9vwUG">music&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkB8eF4ATHl4Jm1BeCZgQ9A">podcasts&lt;/a> while I do this. Hand-mixing a dough is a type of alternative physical therapy; I find it tremendously therapeutic and cathartic. Gorging the dough with soooo much water feels like a crime, TBH. I keep going until the dough tells me to stop&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Salt&lt;/em>: Mix in the salt. The dough is quite sticky. Let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Bran porridge&lt;/em>: Divide the bran porridge into 3-4 portions; spread over the dough one portion at a time; mix until evenly distributed. Let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Triple hydration&lt;/em>: Add the rest of the anise orange water, Rubaud-mixing until completely incorporated. Let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Olive oil&lt;/em>: Drizzle in the olive oil, Rubaud-mixing until entirely combined.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Transfer the dough to a fridge (or somewhere 38F-43F) right away and ferment for 24 hours; take it out a every few hours and perform a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JQm2n4aVZc">coil-fold&lt;/a>. I did 4 folds in total.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>After 24 hours of bulk fermentation, shape the dough into whatever form you want. Let it warm up to room temperature for 2-3 hours before sending it into &lt;em>el horno&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>This Sonora dough went so far beyond my usual &lt;em>pan de cristal&lt;/em> hydration level &amp;ndash; and it&amp;rsquo;s supposedly a &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; wheat!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>White whole wheat is always magical: the bran, germ, and midds become &amp;ldquo;invisible&amp;rdquo; after baking, and you can&amp;rsquo;t tell it&amp;rsquo;s whole wheat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once again, Sonora did not disappoint.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Usually, whole grains (especially with weak gluten) turn bread into a dense brick, but this version is miraculous, with generous &lt;em>alveoli&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>A full-flavored wholegrain bread without the typical aesthetics of a wholegrain bread. The toasted bran porridge adds a ton of custardiness and flavor to the crumb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Definitely not what you would typically expect from a bread made from a &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; wheat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bread&amp;rsquo;s most pronounced characteristic was a subtle buttery, sweet flavor that lingered in my mouth. I think I tasted the Sonoran Desert &amp;ndash; the soil, the texture, the flavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The porous, chewy texture reminded me of a &lt;em>pan corriente&lt;/em> (&amp;ldquo;ordinary bread&amp;rdquo;) that I once had with hot chocolate in Morelia, Mexico.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I secretly think that labeling Sonora as a &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; wheat does it tremendous injustice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I cut this bread into thick slices, and seared them so that they were crisp on one side and as creamy as pudding within. I was planning to serve them to guests topped with different compositions &amp;ndash; crème fraîche, smoked anchovy and arugula, sour cherry jam &amp;ndash; but I was so drawn by the texture that most of the pieces I cooked didn&amp;rsquo;t make it out of the kitchen.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if Sonora is a forlorn or undiscovered bread wheat, but this wheat has lofty potentials.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can see the Sonora flour fulfilling many purposes in cooking and baking because of its unique makeup: It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; heritage wheat with a naturally ivory color, and a subtle, creamy wheat flavor that&amp;rsquo;s almost neutral. A must-try for anyone who prizes the nuances of taste, texture, and performance found only in heritage grains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Hot take&lt;/code>: Using Sonora in cookies, cakes, and pastries severely caps its baking potential. It&amp;rsquo;s a waste. FFS, use Frederick (SWWW, 7.5%-9% protein) in such things. Spare Sonora &amp;ndash; it can do so much better.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Another perk: I learned that a very important but often overlooked reason why California, instead of an East Coast city, became the tech mecca, is because in the eastern states, intellectual property created by an employee belongs to the employer, whereas in California it has historically belonged to the employee. Therefore, in software, an employee could come up with an innovative idea, take investment, and become a CEO. This attracted VCs and talented, ambitious engineers.

&lt;p>For beauty, California is like the fresh, glowing, golden crescent moon; it is waxing steadily to a noble fullness of development.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Inez Haynes Irwin, &lt;em>The Californiacs&lt;/em> (1919)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The California coast always looks so sunny and breathtaking, completely concealing the fact that most of the state is too dry to allow for a lot of life to thrive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/california-dreamin-1">part 1&lt;/a>, I mentioned how California is a great exception to the rest of the US. Here&amp;rsquo;s yet another example: California is one of the few places where 4 of the 5 global climate zones (and 10 different climate subdivisions) occur in close proximity. Perhaps the only other place on the planet similar to California is central Chile, where this convergence is made even more extreme by the dramatic Andean topography.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/california-dreamin-3/california-koppen-climates.png"
alt="Koppen climates in California"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Much of the state boasts a Mediterranean-style climate, which is rare outside of the Mediterranean Sea region. The one in California actually has 3 variations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>cool summers and mild winters along the coast and the western slope of the Sierra Nevada;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cool summers and mild winters, also along the coast, but with frequent summer fog;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mild wet winters followed by hot dry summers with little or no rain for months, in the interior valley.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>With all types, most of the rain falls in winter &amp;ndash; not summer &amp;ndash; which is unusual for most of the world, where the opposite happens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Precipitation levels also vary from year to year. Droughts come and go; extreme, multi-year statewide droughts have occurred several times throughout the past century; regional droughts have also plagued different parts of the state over the years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, most of California&amp;rsquo;s rain and snow fall in the northern half of the state &amp;ndash; in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, along the North Coast, and in the Cascade Range. However, most of the state&amp;rsquo;s population lives in the tremendously drier southern half.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the variability in precipitation and the imbalance in population, California depends on a large network of reservoirs, dams, and aqueducts to store and transport surface water where and when people need it. According to a &lt;a href="https://lao.ca.gov/publications/report/3571">2017 report&lt;/a> from the Legislative Analyst&amp;rsquo;s Office, California has &amp;gt;20,000 miles of levees and channels, and over 1,500 dams and reservoirs. Make no mistake, California&amp;rsquo;s various flood control projects have been funded by the federal government.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yup, &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/california-books">a great deal&lt;/a> about California does not, on its own preferred terms, add up.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This extreme reliance of California on federal money, so seemingly at odds with the emphasis on unfettered individualism that constitutes the local core belief, was a pattern set early on, and derived in part from the very individualism it would seem to belie.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In southern California, water travels a great distance to get to people&amp;rsquo;s faucets: ~25% of the water used in southern California comes from the Colorado River; another 30% from the northern Sierras via the State Water Project; and the remaining 45% comes from a mix of &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo; supplies, including the City of Los Angeles' eastern Sierra deliveries as well as desalination, recycling, and groundwater.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Real-life California water wars (implicating everyone from local philanthropists right up to then-President Theodore Roosevelt) inspired the 1974 film noir &lt;em>Chinatown&lt;/em>, which played down the extent of the corruption involved. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that later dystopian movies like &lt;em>Blade Runner&lt;/em> (1982) imagined a future Los Angeles of 2019 as a rain-soaked wasteland, after all the havoc that city officials wrought on the area&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem for personal profit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The digital world is a lot of fun and undeniably innovative; search engines are ad vehicles and AI-powered voice assistants suck. Still, technology hasn&amp;rsquo;t been able to abstract away reality, and people seem to forget that it&amp;rsquo;s changes in the physical world that drive a lot of living standard improvements. Given how many people struggle in low-end jobs and how quickly tech expenditures are going up, claiming the internet is great smacks of &amp;ldquo;let them eat iPhones!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Competition for water is only growing and intensifying throughout California, particularly in the Central Valley.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWRs5B7rWYw" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The Central Valley is very easy to ignore &amp;ndash; not in any way as glamorous as Silicon Valley or Hollywood &amp;ndash; but it&amp;rsquo;s as important to eaters (aka. all of us) as Silicon Valley is to smartphone users or Hollywood is to moviegoers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bordered on either side by mountains, the Central Valley stretches ~450 miles long from Redding to Bakersfield and ~50 miles wide on average, and occupies a land mass of 18,000 square miles (11.5 million acres) &amp;ndash; roughly the size of Massachusetts and Vermont combined. This valley is predominantly used for agriculture; it occupies &amp;lt;1% of US farmland, but supplies ~25% of Americans' food and accounts for 20% of the nation&amp;rsquo;s groundwater demand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This valley contains the world&amp;rsquo;s largest patch of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Joaquin_(soil)">Class 1 soil&lt;/a>, the best there is. The ~25°F temperature swing from day to night is an ideal growing range for plants. The sun shines nearly 300 days a year. The eastern half of the valley (and the western, to some extent) uses snowpack melt from the Sierra as its water source, i.e. it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the same drought and flood problems as the Midwest. The winters are extremely mild with no snow, which offers a whole different growing season for plants that don&amp;rsquo;t adore summer heat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mild temperatures and winter rain support some of the highest biodiversity in the state. A few hundred different crops are grown in the valley, including those indigenous to South Asia, Southeast Asia and Mexico. Interestingly, some of that is canceled out by California&amp;rsquo;s Desert climates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The expansive Central Valley is really two valleys: the Sacramento Valley to the north and the San Joaquin Valley to the south. The Steppe climate of the San Joaquin Valley is oppressively hot and dry like a desert, but averages enough moisture to support grasslands and other vegetation that commonly loathe the desert.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Central Valley became widely known in the 1920s and 1930s, when farmers arrived from the eastern US, Oklahoma, Italy or Armenia and wrote home about the clean air, bountiful water and cheap land. This massive swath is now among the world&amp;rsquo;s most productive agricultural region &amp;ndash; and has helped California transformed from an agricultural backwater to one of the crown jewels of the US food system. The valley now produces almost all of the almonds, pistachios, and walnuts consumed domestically; &amp;gt;=90% of the artichokes, broccolis, carrots, celeries, garlic, grapes, plums, and tangerines; &amp;gt;=75% of the apricots, cauliflowers, lemons, strawberries, and raspberries; and &amp;gt;=40% of the cabbages, lettuces, oranges, peaches, and peppers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Central Valley is patently &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Steinbeck&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> country. There are many fascinating places there like the &lt;a href="https://dustbowlcamp.org/history/">Weedpatch Camp&lt;/a>, the &lt;a href="https://www.bodie.com/plan/">Bodie&lt;/a> ghost town, the Japanese Internment Camp (aka. &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/manz/index.htm">Manzanar War Relocation Center&lt;/a>), Death Valley, Mount Whitney (the highest peak in the lower 48 states).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>During the dry years, the people forgot about the rich years, and when the wet years returned, they lost all memory of the dry years. It was always that way.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>John Steinbeck, &lt;em>East of Eden&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Nothing much has changed in California and the Salinas Valley since 1952 when Steinbeck wrote &lt;em>East of Eden&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Farming and food production in the Central Valley are extremely vulnerable to droughts and floods. In a normal year, ~50% of the water used in the Central Valley comes from groundwater. During drought, when less water is available from rivers and canals, agriculture in the Central Valley typically depends on groundwater for over 2/3 of its water supplies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As California enters exceptional &lt;a href="https://cww.water.ca.gov/droughtindicator">drought&lt;/a>, groundwater supplies throughout the Central Valley are being withdrawn faster than nature can replenish.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mSBOseNiZg" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This is nothing new. Declines in groundwater levels have plagued the Central Valley for decades. Groundwater, according to one study, is effectively nonrenewable, because it can take centuries for aquifers to replenish once they are depleted, particularly in arid areas without significant rainfall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another study found that the depletion has worsened significantly since 2019, in a race to the bottom. Farmers need as much water as they can take out of the aquifers to farm the land in the hot and dry San Joaquin Valley.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When groundwater levels keep on dropping, land surface can begin to subside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indeed, the overdrafting of the aquifer is causing portions of the valley floor to sink. As diminishing water levels leave spaces underground in layers of gravel, sand and clay, the ground collapses and permanently reduces the aquifer&amp;rsquo;s water-bearing capacity. In parts of the valley, the land has been sinking about 1 ft a year, damaging canals and wells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the groundwater disappears, so too does the food production. That means food shortages and higher food prices. By 2040, the San Joaquin Valley is projected to lose over &lt;a href="https://www.ppic.org/wp-content/uploads/water-and-the-future-of-the-san-joaquin-valley-february-2019.pdf">535,000 acres&lt;/a> of agricultural production. That&amp;rsquo;s &amp;gt;10% of the area farmed!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, towns in the Central Valley are beginning to run out of municipal water. Across the state, electric grids are also at risk if hydroelectric dams don&amp;rsquo;t get enough water to produce power. How are 10% of California&amp;rsquo;s car owners going to operate their Teslas?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the next two decades, California could lose ~10% of its water supplies. A growing number of scientists say the Golden State&amp;rsquo;s great &amp;ldquo;aridification&amp;rdquo; could permanently and profoundly change the state&amp;rsquo;s landscape and social fabric.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What would John Steinbeck have written about the ongoing drought in California?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s the flip side to the megadrought? Megaflood?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>California&amp;rsquo;s climate, already chaotic under normal conditions, is only getting weirder and wilder. Even if California does get enough rain this year to end the drought, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the fact that the ongoing water crisis is worsening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It amazes me even more that the scarcest economic resources &amp;ndash; entrepreneurial ability and technical talent &amp;ndash; are spent on automating a globally abundant resource (i.e. cheap labor) and creating new variants of digital cocaine that are arguably more addictive and more harmful than cigarettes, instead of solving real-world problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>In California, water is now the most precious crop of all. Some farmers have realized that it makes better economic sense to sell unused water than to grow water-intensive crops like rice and almonds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A huge transformation is happening up and down California&amp;rsquo;s Central Valley, as the agricultural labor supply shrinks and water becomes scarcer. Vast stretches of land are now fallow because there&amp;rsquo;s no water. New calculations are being made about what specific crops to grow, how much, and where. Millions of dollars are being spent on replenishing the aquifer that has been depleted for so long.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the era of greater weather volatility, when water can be unreliable, adaptability is an asset.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Which is why landrace plant varieties like the &lt;strong>Sonora Blanca&lt;/strong> wheat are important. Wheat production still requires water, but a lot less than growing rice, nuts or fruits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/desert-dynamo">ICYMI&lt;/a>, Sonora is a heritage soft white winter wheat brought to the Americas by Spanish missionaries in the 1600s. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the &lt;a href="https://slowfoodusa.org/white-sonora-wheat/">oldest&lt;/a> varieties cultivated in North America, predating &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/red-fife/">Red Fife&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/turkey-red/">Turkey Red&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s also sometimes called Father Kino&amp;rsquo;s wheat, after Father Eusebio Francisco Kino who established Catholic missions throughout the Pimera Alta (present-day Sonora and southern Arizona) in the late 1600s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The earliest known cultivation records document the grain&amp;rsquo;s existence in the early 1700s in the mountains of Sonora, a region in northern Mexico. That&amp;rsquo;s probably where the variety earned its name; to this day, Sonoran tortillas are more often made from soft wheat flour than maize like in the rest of Mexico.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the 1800s, Sonora wheat was widely planted in California and other areas in the southwestern US; it was a predominant source of flour for the western population, until the rise of industrialization after World War I, when hybridized high-yield commodity wheat replaced it. By the 1980s, Sonora was commercially dead. Luckily &amp;ndash; for those of us who care &amp;ndash; Sonora has been revived in the southwest thanks to the local-grain movement that spread like wildfire across the US.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="Sonora Blanca vs. Joaquin Oro"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Sonora Blanca (left) vs. Joaquin Oro (right), both grown in the San Joaquin Valley of California.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Sonora&amp;rsquo;s heritage earns it some clout by default. More importantly, the wheat has been adapting to the drought conditions in California for &lt;em>hundreds of years&lt;/em> (shall we crown it &amp;ldquo;the OG California Wheat?&amp;quot;). This adaptability has made the landrace variety popular among California grain farmers. Drought-tolerance eliminates the need for expensive irrigation. Additionally, Sonora&amp;rsquo;s lower protein content requires less input from the farmer, and lower nitrogen requirement makes it perfectly suitable for organic farming (no need to worry about the nitrogen content of the soil).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I baked with &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/desert-dynamo">Arizona-grown Sonora&lt;/a> a while ago, and named it &amp;ldquo;desert dynamo.&amp;rdquo; I still think it&amp;rsquo;s aptly named and well deserved. Everyone was telling me it was impossible to bake a lofty bread out of soft wheat alone, so I made a 100% Sonora bread just to show them it &lt;em>can&lt;/em> be done. The bread turned out so bloody marvelous it blew my expectations out of the water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to generous friends at the California Wheat Commission, I got a chance to delve deeper into Sonora &amp;ndash; with the San Joaquin Valley terroir (grown by Eck Farms, CA).&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Sonora actually can be planted in either fall or spring. It&amp;rsquo;s an early spring variety that does equally well as a winter wheat in milder winter climates that don&amp;rsquo;t freeze hard.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/california-dreamin-3/sonora-backyard.jpg"
alt="Sonora growing in a 4×4 garden bed"/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Sonora growing in a 4ft × 4ft garden bed.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Source: &lt;a href="https://gardenerd.com/blog/growing-white-sonora-wheat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gardenerd&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In southern California, even if you plant Sonora in October as a winter wheat, the climate there doesn&amp;rsquo;t really allow for winter wheat to behave like a winter wheat, which ordinarily grows low and wide in late fall, goes dormant in winter, then emerges and branches out in spring to maturity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sonora has a relatively high protein content (~12.7%), but is typically characterized as a &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; wheat &amp;ndash; which befuddles me. The often-cited reason is that Sonora has inadequate &lt;a href="https://modernistcuisine.com/mc/gluten-how-does-it-work/">gluten-forming proteins&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;ve never done individual testing of the glutenin and gliadin fractions in any wheat, nor am I interested in such, so don&amp;rsquo;t ask me. What I do know is that &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6oQNo4gpeE">protein content&lt;/a> of a flour tells you little about the flour&amp;rsquo;s strength or baking performance. Some amino acids that make up the protein are usually water-soluble and contribute little to the strength of the flour, so a high-protein flour can actually have weak gluten.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>My &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/desert-dynamo">last bake&lt;/a> with Sonora proved to me that the flour is indeed capable of making a stretchable dough &amp;ndash; far more stretchable than a dough made with other soft wheats like Frederick (7.5%-9% protein) or even some hard wheats like &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/orange-sunshine">Warthog&lt;/a>; and apparently stretchable enough that Sonorans developed large flour tortillas, burritos and chimichangas with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sonoran-style flour tortillas (&lt;em>tortillas de harina estilo Sonora&lt;/em>) are works of art; they are stretched paper thin and cooked on a hot griddle, producing small blisters that give them a smoky flavor. Check out &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-patricia-escarcega-sonoratown-review-20190424-story.html">Sonoratown&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s glorious flour tortillas in downtown Los Angeles, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t. They are freshly made daily, with &lt;a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019621-sonoran-style-flour-tortillas">5 ingredients&lt;/a>: salt, water, lard, baking powder and soft Sonoran wheat flour produced in San Luis Río Colorado, on the Mexico-US border. These $10 plates of Sonoran tacos are so spectacular that hundreds of Angelenos would rather spend their time lining up in front of Sonoratown than going to flashy dinners at the world-famous &lt;a href="https://la.eater.com/2019/12/18/21028471/tartine-manufactory-downtown-los-angeles-the-row-closed-why">Tartine&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>A side note: If you have ever spent some time in Arizona, you may have noticed that the most distinctive marker of Arizonan cuisine is Sonoran-style Mexican food, an approach to border cooking that differs from Tex-Mex, New Mexican, or Baja styles and is seldom found outside of Arizona. Unlike the rest of Mexico where maize is king, Sonora is a wheat-growing region where the flour tortilla gets special attention, although they still use corn tortillas for a variety of dishes. In California, you are asked if you want flour or corn tortillas with dinner. In the Sonoran-style restaurants of Arizona, it&amp;rsquo;s assumed that you want the flour version.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Sonora wheat berries are moderately hard, and lend themselves to milling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similar to &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/joaquin-oro/">Joaquin Oro&lt;/a>, Sonora mills to a fine, soft wholegrain flour on the first run (on a countertop electric WonderMill set to Bread Flour).&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Since Sonora is commercially classified as a &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; wheat, a lot of bakers automatically pass it up in breadmaking and use it instead in scones, biscuits, pies, muffins, tortillas, cookies, and cakes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, Sonora has a hidden kick of strength (&amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/desert-dynamo">desert dynamo&lt;/a>&amp;quot;) that makes it work for many purposes and many meals. You can feed your family all three meals relying on just Sonora: biscuits/scones/muffins/tortillas for breakfast, naans or breads for lunch/dinner, and cakes/cookies throughout the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are new to Sonora and other heritage wheat flours, start with a familiar recipe such as chocolate chip cookies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;code>Note&lt;/code>: I didn&amp;rsquo;t use any eggs in these cookies, because eggs have been scarce on store shelves; whatever eggs I manage to track down, they are selling at &lt;a href="https://eggspensive.net/">record high prices&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>The process is super simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make the super &lt;em>masa madre&lt;/em>: Mix together the whole wheat flour, malt, water, and sourdough into a stiff ball. Let it ferment in a warm place for 3-4 hours, or until doubled in volume. Keep an eye on it &amp;ndash; you don&amp;rsquo;t want it to overripen and get sour.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Break up the &lt;em>masa madre&lt;/em>. Add the rest of the ingredients except the chocolate chips; mix until homogeneous.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Stir in the chocolate chips; mix until evenly dispersed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Scoop onto a baking tray, spaced about 2&amp;rdquo; apart. (Chill the dough and the scoop first for 15-20 minutes, if you prefer thicker cookies.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Bake for 15 minutes at 300F, or until spread out and light brown.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Here are three tricks to the very best chocolate cookies:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Use fresh wholegrain flour!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add 10% malted barley flour.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brown the butter to accentuate the maltiness of the flours. Do yourself a favor and get a block of high-quality butter: 83% from Wisconsin, Kerrygold, New Zealand butter, or Isigny Sainte-Mère.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>These cookies were gone within a few hours of emerging from the oven, so I had to make a 2nd freakin' batch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I happened to have a few gorgeous beetroots (probably from California&amp;rsquo;s San Joaquin Valley, too), so I roasted the cubed beets on a charcoal-fired BBQ grill until perfectly caramelized. Then I puréed the beets in a blender, and added some of the red gold into the cookie dough.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A little-known fact about John Steinbeck is that he was a travel writer. His nonfiction book, &lt;em>Travels With Charley&lt;/em>, preceded other great American road trip novels by Jack Kerouac, Studs Terkel, etc. In 1962, John Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for his body of work. The Nobel Committee wrote: &amp;ldquo;His sympathies always go out to the oppressed, the misfits, and the distressed; he likes to contrast the simple joy of life with the brutal and cynical craving for money. But in him we find the American temperament also expressed in his great feelings for the tilled soil, the wasteland, the mountains, and the ocean coast&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Stranger, let me warn you now. If ever you start for California with the intention of seeing anything of the State, do that before you enter San Francisco. If you must land in San Francisco first, jump into a taxi, pull down the curtains, drive through the city, breaking every speed law, to &amp;ldquo;Third and Townsend,&amp;rdquo; sit in the station until a train &amp;ndash; some train, any train &amp;ndash; pulls out, and go with it. If in crossing Market Street, you raise that taxi-curtain as much as an inch, believe me, stranger, it&amp;rsquo;s all off; you&amp;rsquo;re lost. You&amp;rsquo;ll never leave San Francisco. Myself, both times I have gone to California, I have vowed to see Yosemite, the big trees, the string of beautiful old missions which dot the state, some of the quaint, languid, semi-tropical towns of the south, some of the brisk, brilliant, bustling towns of the north. But I have never really done it because I saw San Francisco first.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>NYC boasts the best bagels in the world, which New Yorkers attribute to their magical tap water. San Francisco boasts the finest sourdough in the world, which San Franciscans attribute to their special air. The unseen native inhabitants in San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s damp, foggy micro-climate, they claim, create a special &amp;ldquo;microbial terroir&amp;rdquo; that can&amp;rsquo;t be replicated anywhere else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And for a San Francisco sourdough to be truly &amp;ldquo;authentic,&amp;rdquo; the local history and mythology go, it has to be born in San Francisco with proper San Franciscan air, not in Oakland, Richmond, or San Jose. (BTW, everyone hates Oakland, except people who actually live there and pay half the rent of what people pay in San Francisco while still basically living in San Francisco.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No one has convinced more people about the unique qualities of San Francisco sourdough than Boudin Bakery, which &lt;a href="https://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Yeast_to_Wheat:_How_Boudin_Bakery%E2%80%99s_Yeast_Culture_Shaped_San_Francisco%E2%80%99s_Counterculture">claims&lt;/a> to have been selling the same loaf of bread made with The Original San Francisco Sourdough™ for &amp;gt;170 years. According to the Boudin Bakery museum at the ultra-touristy Fisherman&amp;rsquo;s Wharf, the company&amp;rsquo;s mother dough follows an unbroken line back to the Gold Rush in 1849. Louise Boudin even saved the starter from a burning building during the 1906 earthquake. A museum docent will readily inform you the starter is so special and irreplaceable that the Boudin mothership sends its retail stores fresh starter every 23 days. Without it, they emphasize, the sourdough produced at those stores would stop tasting like San Francisco sourdough &amp;ndash; and start tasting like Sacramento or San Diego sourdough, which is absolutely blasphemous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, according to the museum, Boudin&amp;rsquo;s bread owes its special flavor to a particular strain of lactic acid bacteria that thrives &lt;em>only&lt;/em> in San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s climate. Scientists identified it here in 1970, so they named it &lt;em>Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a great, great story. Too bad it&amp;rsquo;s not quite true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scientists did identify &lt;em>Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis&lt;/em> in San Francisco. But recent studies have found it in &lt;a href="www.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/dining/for-gastronomists-a-go-to-microbiologist.html">90% of the world&amp;rsquo;s sourdough&lt;/a>, too. So from a biological standpoint, San Francisco sourdough is not all that distinctive &amp;ndash; or unique to San Francisco.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you take your precious local sourdough starter and bake with it in Los Angeles, I bet the resulting bread will taste very similar to what you make in San Francisco. Blasphemy! But likely&amp;hellip;true. Even breads made without &lt;em>Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis&lt;/em> can taste pretty darn good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much for the &amp;ldquo;microbial terroir&amp;rdquo; myth. Even bakers who have been in a position to benefit from the reputation of local sourdough don&amp;rsquo;t embrace the cachet. Call a dog a dog &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s pure marketing. It sells the city, turning sourdough into another tourist attraction that San Francisco is famous for, besides the bridge and the bay.&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>There are 3 bread institutions in the San Francisco Bay Area: Acme, Semifreddi&amp;rsquo;s, and Tartine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Acme is often credited as an OG pioneer of the San Francisco Bay Area&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Bread Revolution,&amp;rdquo; which in turn galvanized the modern &amp;ldquo;artisan bread&amp;rdquo; movement across America; to this day, Acme&amp;rsquo;s bread remains a &amp;ldquo;benchmark&amp;rdquo; for commercial handmade bread. It was a stalwart of the 1980s artisan baking scene, along with Semifreddi&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Newer upstarts like Tartine and Josey Baker Bread have brought on some serious competition, and challenged the status quo of what San Francisco bread is &lt;em>supposed&lt;/em> to taste like and, along the way, the status quo of home baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2006, the NY Times food columnist Mark Bittman &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/06/dining/06mini.html">wrote about&lt;/a> a NYC baker named Jim Lahey, the man behind Sullivan Street Bakery who had developed a no-knead bread recipe that consisted of only 4 steps and required just 4 ingredients &amp;ndash; flour, water, salt, and yeast. While not the OG recipe of its kind, the &amp;ldquo;no-knead&amp;rdquo; method spread like wildfire. It revolutionized the food world; its simplicity miraculously democratized breadmaking for the home baker. Lahey became a semi-god figure &amp;ndash; the Prometheus who gifted the art of breadmaking to the masses. He released a cookbook in 2009, titled &lt;em>My Bread: The Revolutionary No-Work, No-Knead Method&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few years earlier, a transplanted New Yorker named Elizabeth Pruitt and her husband Chad Robertson moved their tiny baking operation from Point Reyes, California south to an unassuming corner of Guerrero Street, at the edge of the Mission District in San Francisco. They named it Tartine, and churned out artisan breads, viennoiseries and sandwiches. The bakery garnered praise from Alice Waters and Martha Stewart, and made the cake for a &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Why-the-concert-was-canceled-3314257.php">&amp;ldquo;bohemian bourgeois&amp;rdquo;-themed birthday party&lt;/a> attended by Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton. Mark Bittman &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/travel/28Bite.html">described&lt;/a> their shop as one of the best French-style bakeries in the country, and particularly raved about Tartine&amp;rsquo;s sandwiches, which were made on &amp;ldquo;Mr. Robertson&amp;rsquo;s exceptional bread, notable because it&amp;rsquo;s a slow-fermented yeast bread in very French style that is a welcome change from the ubiquitous sourdough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>San Franciscans started lining up outside the shop to get a taste of what Prueitt and Robertson were baking; the queues outside Tartine became a local landmark and a symbol of a changing city. (Lines beget lines; the success of Tartine&amp;rsquo;s OG location is arguably one of the reasons that San Francisco gained a reputation as a place where people would wait in line for any sort of &amp;ldquo;cult&amp;rdquo; food item.) Tartine&amp;rsquo;s bread started to become a Veblen good, just as Prueitt and Robertson started to become food-world celebrities. In 2010, the influential &lt;em>Tartine Bread&lt;/em> was published; Robertson revealed to the world his recipe for French-style sourdough, which called for folding, shaping, scoring, and a grasp of wild yeast. The change from Lahey&amp;rsquo;s no-knead bread to Robertson&amp;rsquo;s sourdough was remarkable; home baking was about to become more technical and more precise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The complete recipe for Basic Country Bread, the edible hero of &lt;em>Tartine Bread&lt;/em>, runs 38 pages, including photographs. It was instantly celebrated as a &amp;ldquo;masterpiece&amp;rdquo; in media, along the lines of a Martin Scorsese tracking shot or a Marcel Proust sentence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Robertson wrote about bread in a detailed but flexible way: The prose is lean and direct; the instructions don&amp;rsquo;t just tell you what to do but explain why, what to look for, and how to make corrections, encouraging you to see his laborious artisan craft as adaptable and welcoming of interpretation. Robertson was also a laid-back surfer who radiated a particular kind of Gen X bohemianism, which inadvertently imbued breadmaking with a sort of new masculine sheen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seemingly, Robertson gave away the store. The bread he teaches you to make is essentially the same bread that has turned him into one of the most influential bakers in the world; it&amp;rsquo;s what causes otherwise rational adults to mob the line at Tartine Bakery. The fact is, Tartine multiplied its influence by opening up about the way they do things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Tartine Bread&lt;/em> could have merely been aspirational, but it&amp;rsquo;s just too &lt;em>actionable&lt;/em>. The recipes work, and they inspire. All of a sudden, many of Tartine&amp;rsquo;s fans took up artisan baking at home &amp;ndash; a majority of whom happened to be guys in tech.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For tech geeks in the San Francisco Bay Area, &lt;em>Tartine Bread&lt;/em> had it all:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a recipe that encouraged iteration and a grasp of the scientific nature of wild fermentation;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a craft that was not frivolous or quintessentially feminine like making cupcakes; and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a cool leader that inspires emulation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Technologists stormed sourdough with a host of tools and techniques that built on Robertson&amp;rsquo;s artisan approach. Ken Forkish, who had quit his job at IBM to become a baker, wrote &lt;em>Flour Water Salt Yeast&lt;/em> and won a James Beard Award in 2013. Nathan Myhrvold, the former CTO of Microsoft and current CEO of patent and investment firm Intellectual Ventures, released a 5-volume cookbook called &lt;em>Modernist Bread&lt;/em> in 2017. It also won a James Beard. High-efficiency tools like $150 Brød &amp;amp; Taylor Folding Bread Proofer that offers &amp;ldquo;precision control&amp;rdquo; over temperature and humidity, or the $300 Fourneau bread oven, which &amp;ldquo;traps steam and radiates powerful heat&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;helps you achieve oven spring&amp;rdquo;, came on the market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overnight, Silicon Valley venture capitalists started tweeting about their fine sourdough starters; UX designers started buying $600 bannetons and taking extensive notes about each bake in apps like Evernote, Google Keep, Notion and Bear; and tender #crumbshots popped up all over breadstagram. Everyone in Silicon Valley is Very Publicly Into Sourdough All of a Sudden. People couldn&amp;rsquo;t delight more in the miracles of this alchemy than if it were neolithic times and bread was just invented yesterday. Breadmaking has become the latest form of romantic consumerism.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The Perfect Loaf, a sourdough bread blog launched in 2013 by Maurizio Leo, a software engineer by trade, is frequently cited as an entry point to baking for men in tech, as his approach speaks to technically-oriented individuals and, as his blog name implies, is pursuant of mastery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Breadmaking is now seen as a sort of an &amp;ldquo;algorithm&amp;rdquo;; it&amp;rsquo;s expected to produce a certain result and if that result isn&amp;rsquo;t always what you expect, you step back and diagnose the steps along the way. Working on bread recipes has become a new form of &amp;ldquo;debugging.&amp;rdquo; That iterative procedure for optimization appeals to the engineering mind, not to mention the precision part. Breadmaking also offers various degrees of freedom &amp;ndash; it could be implemented in lots of different possible ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a liberating escape, particularly when you work in tech for a living and can&amp;rsquo;t turn that technical side of your brain off and your work becomes so embedded in your life that it consumes you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like religion, romanticism also has its liminal rituals, which decouple the subjective feelings of pleasure and freedom from material goods and mass-marketed symbols, and disrupt the daily tedium and hierarchies, transporting us, through the consumption of goods and services labeled romantic, into a fantastic world in which ordinary annoyances, our own limitations and, with a little luck, even our most objectionable caprices, are temporarily interrupted. Maybe baking is an opportunity for these technologists to rehabilitate their humanity, when they are not busy creating apps that make money off everyone&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;addiction&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Sourdough&lt;/em>, a 2017 novel by Robin Sloan, pokes fun at the obnoxious foodie culture of Silicon Valley while also ribbing the folks who are so eager to innovate it &amp;ndash; the tech guys who obsess over an ancient idea, commit to disrupting it, then get bored and move on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason that Chad Robertson became a god among tech-oriented breadmaking hobbyists is perhaps more shallow than one might think: Robertson and Tartine are instrumental to this whole trend because he was in San Francisco just as this mid-2000s tech wave was taking off. Right place, right time. Right guy, right craft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When Robertson &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHUU9dcHVng">spoke&lt;/a> about the intersection of tech and bread at a Wired conference in 2015, he said as much, noting that the reason he and Prueitt even moved their bakery to San Francisco in the first place was because the burst of the dotcom bubble in the early 2000s finally made it affordable for them to do so: The median rent for a two-bedroom apartment had fallen from $3,000 a month to just under $2,000. Development had slowed, evictions and unemployment had spiked, and commercial vacancies had risen. In the Mission District, a historically working-class and Latino neighborhood, artists' spaces battled with real-estate developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tartine had thrived during an economic downturn. Now it&amp;rsquo;s operating in one of the most expensive cities in the world, where a 21-year-old earning low six-figures is considered a peasant.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Tartine has undergone rapid expansion since Chad Robertson personally manned the ovens at the OG store on Guerrero Street, shuttling out a limited number of loaves every evening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2014, the Oakland-born and San Francisco-raised Blue Bottle, the most dominant company riding the &amp;ldquo;third wave&amp;rdquo; coffee trend, had just &lt;a href="https://valleywag.gawker.com/blue-bottle-which-raised-45-m-cut-health-benefits-fo-1663442765">raised $45 million dollars&lt;/a> in venture capital for its own expansion, and needed a bakery partner to provide food in its coffee shops. Tartine soon announced a &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-tartine-blue-bottle-merging-20150420-story.html">merger&lt;/a> with the company; the news turned heads in the northern California food world and beyond. Anticipating a personal windfall, Prueitt and Robertson moved into a luxurious circa 1960 house in the Castro district in 2015. Eater SF did a &lt;a href="https://sf.eater.com/2016/2/23/11098328/tartine-bakery-liz-prueitt-chad-robertson-home-kitchen#11">photo shoot&lt;/a> of their newly remodeled home kitchen, showing off their specialized kitchenware and verdant backyard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By February 2016 when the Eater piece went live, the Blue Bottle acquisition had &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/restaurants/article/Blue-Bottle-and-Tartine-Bakery-nix-merger-6673950.php">fallen apart&lt;/a>. The couple put the Castro house up for sale and quietly moved out in early 2018. Still, Tartine Manufactory, a restaurant and bar concept conceived in their sleek, airy home kitchen, opened in the summer of 2016. &lt;a href="https://sf.eater.com/2016/8/17/12513334/tartine-manufactory-san-francisco-mission-photos">Eater SF&lt;/a> lauded the 5,000-sqft space as &amp;ldquo;an artisanal utopia in the Mission&amp;rdquo;; every detail was designed to represent &amp;ldquo;a new type of luxury.&amp;rdquo; Meanwhile, Tartine launched its own coffee brand, &lt;a href="https://sprudge.com/tartines-coffee-manufactory-roasting-destiny-san-francisco-107956.html">Coffee Manufactory&lt;/a>, in partnership with a former Starbucks executive who is now the Chief Operations Officer of Tartine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of Tartine&amp;rsquo;s partners and investors is a real-estate private-equity firm called CIM Group, one of the largest property owners in Los Angeles and a prominent commercial landlord in Oakland, managing about $30 billion dollars in assets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tartine&amp;rsquo;s Coffee Manufactory planned to move into Jack London Square, a 434,000-sqft waterfront property in Oakland acquired by CIM in 2016 as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/restaurants/article/Jack-London-Square-cooks-up-a-new-generation-of-11231529.php">$131 million deal&lt;/a> for long-term development. CIM billed the Coffee Manufactory as an anchor tenant &amp;ndash; a business that could attract customers and other businesses, increasing the overall value and cachet of the area. The developer was curating the neighborhood with buildings and tenants.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Tartine was a particularly appealing anchor tenant. The food was great, and most of it could be made off-site, requiring a fairly modest square footage for retail sites. And Tartine had a history: the flagship location, with its artistic staff and communal ambiance, radiated the sort of authenticity that a real-estate developer could only dream of cultivating. Year on year, Tartine’s brand had become cooler, airier, and more transportable.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Images of Tartine&amp;rsquo;s pastries and its OG Guerrero Street bakery started to pop up in &lt;a href="hhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/michellerial/morning-bun">Apple commercials and product demos&lt;/a>. Sweetgreen, the East Coast fast-casual salad chain that was now proliferating along the West Coast, started to offer &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://sf.eater.com/2017/8/30/16227094/sweetgreen-tartine-manufactory-salad-bowl-san-francisco-bay">The Tartine Bowl&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, plucked from Prueitt&amp;rsquo;s recently published book &lt;em>Tartine All Day&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tartine&amp;rsquo;s brand became another recognizable symbol of &lt;a href="https://archive.is/mmUwT">gentrification&lt;/a>; the opening of a Tartine seemed to hint that a neighborhood was on the cusp of it. The process of bringing intense, aggressive real-estate development to upper-middle-class neighborhoods, to cater to an even more affluent stratum, is gentrification on steroids.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In January 2019, Tartine opened &lt;a href="https://sf.eater.com/2019/1/22/18193239/manufactory-food-hall-sfo-tartine-cala-kamine-san-francisco-international-airport">the Manufactory Food Hall&lt;/a> in San Francisco International Airport.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That spring, Tartine opened a splashy &lt;a href="https://la.eater.com/2019/1/28/18200748/manufactory-row-tartine-chris-bianco-los-angeles-photos-inside">new 40,000-sqft Tartine Manufactory&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; three times the size of its first Manufactory in San Francisco &amp;ndash; in the Row, a huge, newly developed compound in Downtown Los Angeles (DTLA). &lt;em>Food &amp;amp; Wine&lt;/em> published a feature on Robertson and Prueitt, with the headline &amp;ldquo;With L.A. Opening, Tartine Positions Itself for World Domination.&amp;rdquo; F*ck yeah, Silicon Valley-style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CIM invested in Tartine&amp;rsquo;s 5 new locations in Los Angeles (&lt;a href="https://la.eater.com/2019/1/10/18177207/tartine-silver-lake-sunset-coming-expansion-news">Silver Lake&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://la.eater.com/2019/7/29/20746164/tartine-hollywood-bakery-san-francisco-opening-sycamore-news">West Hollywood&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://la.eater.com/2019/9/6/20853090/tartine-bakery-santa-monica-expansion-opening-funeral-home">Santa Monica&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrassy.com/blog/west-adams-tartine-is-a-welcome-neighborhood-addition">West Adams&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://la.eater.com/2022/2/1/22912646/tartine-pasadena-new-cafe-opening-restaurant-los-angeles-morning-am-intel-news">Pasadena&lt;/a>). For any Angeleno who&amp;rsquo;s ever wondered just how all these Tartines landed in the Southland in the first place, here&amp;rsquo;s an answer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In July 2019, Tartine opened its 3rd San Francisco location, in a CIM-affiliated property in the Inner Sunset neighborhood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In September 2019, Tartine opened its 5th Bay Area location in &lt;a href="https://sf.eater.com/2019/9/16/20868239/tartine-berkeley-bakery-open-graduate-hotel">Berkeley&lt;/a>. The café is tucked into a sunroom at Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s Graduate Hotel (fka. the Hotel Durant), a chain hotel owned by Adventurous Journeys Capital, a self-described &amp;ldquo;vertically integrated real estate investment manager focused on developing and operating transformative real estate assets in spaces often overlooked or undervalued by traditional investment firms.&amp;rdquo; Tartine&amp;rsquo;s new presence at the hotel came as part of a ~$50 million transformation from the Hotel Durant to the Graduate Hotel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Customers who walk into any of Tartine&amp;rsquo;s locations may never feel or realize they are entering part of a real-estate empire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How much of Tartine is owned by CIM and how deeply these two companies are intertwined has never been publicly disclosed. The daughter of a co-founder of CIM is now Tartine&amp;rsquo;s VP of Brand.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Today, Tartine operates 3 locations in the San Francisco Bay Area, 5 in Los Angeles, and 6 licensed locations in Seoul (one of which is located at &lt;a href="https://tartinebakery.com/seoul/dosan">Kinfolk Dosan&lt;/a>, a cultural space created by Kinfolk, an aspirational lifestyle magazine). How can a craft bakery still be artisanal if it has 6 overseas branches?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tartine&amp;rsquo;s workers in San Francisco watched investment flow into the new locations and increasingly felt neglected. They suspected they were the actual engine that propelled Tartine into an empire, but now they couldn&amp;rsquo;t even get a $1/hour raise. There was a lot of confusion about the company&amp;rsquo;s investors &amp;ndash; who were they, and how much power did they wield? Money to pay invoices wasn&amp;rsquo;t there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tartine was expanding, but the OG Mission location was falling apart. In November 2019, the San Francisco Department of Public Health &lt;a href="https://sf.eater.com/2019/11/23/20979306/tartine-rats-rodents-dph-mission">briefly shut down&lt;/a> Tartine&amp;rsquo;s Guerrero Street location, after inspectors say that its operators failed to deal with a persistent rodent infestation in the space.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Workers noticed cultural changes. Shift wine was eliminated, and management introduced a monthly music playlist. Some were dissatisfied with wages, raises, and scheduling. Employees wanted certain benefits, such as paid time off separate from state-mandated sick leave, and raises larger than the annual increases mandated by the city. All this looked feasible to them, given the company’s expansion. When they brought these requests to Tartine’s newly created human-resources department, they were confused to find that it was run out of offices leased from CIM affiliates, in Los Angeles.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>As Tartine expanded rapidly in the last 6-7 years, operational difficulties grew with it. Money was allocated to ventures that didn&amp;rsquo;t pan out. The whole enterprise seemed stretched thin. There seemed to be a fundamental disconnect between perception and reality. New investment was focused on new ventures, but Tartine&amp;rsquo;s expansion relied on the strength of its brand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bar Tartine closed in 2016 and had never turned a profit (since it opened in 2005 just a couple of blocks away from the OG Tartine Bakery). The planned Coffee Manufactory retail space in Jack London Square never opened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In December 2019, Tartine&amp;rsquo;s massive DTLA Manufactory shuttered &amp;ndash; 11 months after it opened. It was a shocking closure. The store laid off its remaining workers 10 days before Christmas.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Tartine’s market, retail baking and takeaway spaces, and multiple restaurants all closed this week after just 11 months of business and a build-out rumored to have run into the tens of millions of dollars. All of the Row is struggling to find sustained weeknight retail traffic right now, but the loss of anchor tenant Tartine has hit the development’s brand particularly hard. There simply were not enough $72 mug buyers around to keep the place afloat, and that seems to say something about Tartine’s visibility and draw, and about the Row overall — not to mention the cost of goods inside. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simply put: Tartine didn’t find a good way to consistently speak to Angelenos, and in a city where driving four miles to have dinner can mean sitting in your car for an hour, answering the “why” of the place not only proved tricky, it likely proved its undoing. &amp;hellip; More than anything, it struggled to define its place at the Row, in Downtown, in a city brimming with home bakers and panaderias and other local bread legends like Friends &amp;amp; Family, Clark Street, and Bub &amp;amp; Grandma’s.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Tartine took on a new investor, Monogram Capital Partners, another private-equity firm &amp;ldquo;focused exclusively on consumer and retail companies.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, Chad Robertson started to show up in &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlundstoneUS/videos/live-in-my-blundstones-chad-robertson/2553319681570138/">sponsored content&lt;/a> for &lt;a href="https://www.blundstone.com/limb-chad-robertson">Blundstone boots&lt;/a> on social media. He and Prueitt divorced in 2020.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given the PE industry&amp;rsquo;s typical M.O. (i.e. the decade-long pyramiding of real estate and overleveraging on ever lower interest rates), I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if Tartine is sinking deeper and deeper into debt &amp;ndash; or might eventually end up like &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/aquaboogie-di-dolce">Dean &amp;amp; DeLuca&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In February 2020, a few short weeks before the Covid lockdown, 141 of Tartine&amp;rsquo;s &amp;gt;200 San Francisco Bay Area employees signed a letter, announcing their decision to unionize with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. It came as a huge surprise, especially at a world-renowned bakery that boasts about ​&amp;quot;production at a human scale&amp;quot; and has been a training ground for young bakers from around the globe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tartine&amp;rsquo;s management declined to recognize the union, and &lt;a href="https://sf.eater.com/2020/2/11/21133479/tartine-union-management-sam-singer">hired Sam Singer&lt;/a>, a longtime San Francisco crisis communications expert known for his work with controversial companies like Chevron&amp;rsquo;s Richmond oil refinery. After letting him go amid criticism, they then hired a Las Vegas-based firm called Quest Consulting to quash the unionizing effort. Quest&amp;rsquo;s founder, Lupe Cruz, has earned himself a &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/union-organizers-and-workers-decry-union-busting-consulting-firms-hired-b/">reputation&lt;/a> among labor organizers as &amp;ldquo;a notorious union-buster who specializes in influencing Latino-dominated workforces.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In March 2021, over a year after voting and following a thorny, protracted dispute over 24 challenged ballots, the National Labor Relations Board announced that Tartine&amp;rsquo;s workers in San Francisco had officially unionized. In May 2022, the Tartine Union began negotiations for its first wage and healthcare contract, which &lt;a href="https://sf.eater.com/2022/8/23/23318336/tartine-bakery-union-negotiations">stalled&lt;/a> a few months later.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>A single person at the right place comes up with a &amp;ldquo;unique&amp;rdquo; recipe at the right time can have the outsized effect of influencing a whole new generation of bakers, and even become a cult figure.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>No single part of Tartine&amp;rsquo;s technique or bread is new or original to me. I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten there several times; nothing about it has blown my mind. Maybe it was groundbreaking a decade ago to the culinarily ignorant masses who grew up on industrial wheatish pulp?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That one guy who lives in San Francisco at the right time with the right trade shouldn&amp;rsquo;t get all the credit for this bread renaissance &amp;ndash; East Coast journalists began to protest. People (mostly women) have been baking bread at home for thousands of years before Robertson and Prueitt opened Tartine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently, &amp;ldquo;nerds&amp;rdquo; over-engineering breadbaking, turning this homegrown, down-to-earth craft into something more technical and complicated than it should be, and &amp;ldquo;pushing&amp;rdquo; women out in the process is &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/2018/11/19/18099127/bread-silicon-valley-sourdough-tech-bros-tartine-chad-robertson">a huge problem&lt;/a>. The gendering of baking has become a hot topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;one of my favorite things about JavaScript is when we discover things 20 years after other languages, besides like the concept of baking your own bread at home instead of purchasing it from the store, we act like we invented fat arrow functions, classes, immutable data, restructuring statements, functional programming &amp;ndash; like, it&amp;rsquo;s like truly wild to witness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;this baking bread thing seems to have come out of like nowhere and it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see. &amp;hellip; I was going to make fun of the parallels between baking bread &amp;ndash; like baking bread from a recipe and implementing an algorithm of code, but I think that the real interesting and problematic parallel is the rhetoric with which JavaScript developers talk about bread. It&amp;rsquo;s super elitist and it&amp;rsquo;s mostly dudes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>why are there no women in tech baking bread? And I feel like &amp;ndash; this is in all seriousness, I feel this pressure now to stop this in its tracks. &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m worried about fucking bread. Like, you think I&amp;rsquo;d have enough emotional labor as a woman in tech to have to deal with baking bread &amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>People in and around San Francisco making sourdough is such a surprising and novel phenomenon that it needs to be picked apart &amp;ndash; because (&lt;em>gasp&lt;/em>!) they happen to be men who work in tech and ruin whatever they lay their hands on for the sake of fashion and &amp;ldquo;disruption.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps the pseudo-celebrity status of Chad Robertson, the ubiquity of Instagram shots that emphasize only the visual aesthetic of breads, etc. speak to humans' shallowness and egotism more than anything else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Who cares about some JavaScript developer in San Francisco who bakes bread at home and runs a blog about it? If anything, it&amp;rsquo;s those who follow them keenly on social media that affirm their authority and turn them into some bread gods. Why are you so desperate for external validation?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of people think that to be a real developer/baker, you need to be prolific on social media. If you don&amp;rsquo;t argue about your trade on Twitter, GitHub or Instagram, you don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>feel like&lt;/em> you are a real developer/baker. Yeah sure. Only if you &lt;em>choose&lt;/em> to play this game and be stuck in this rat race.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t think the scientific approach to bread is a futile endeavor. Why can&amp;rsquo;t the scientific and the intuitive approaches co-exist?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The foundation of bread is super simple and those basic principles are still unchanged. I disagree that it&amp;rsquo;s total hubris to be attempting to innovate and move the art forward. Some folks are actually making significant innovations in breadmaking, and innovation is not an &amp;ldquo;American sickness&amp;rdquo; that needs to be cured. (In fact, I would argue that America needs more innovation &amp;ndash; especially in manufacturing and engineering &amp;ndash; that will tangibly improve the standard of living.) Breads produced with some of the new artisan methods today are actually really good &amp;ndash; in ways that their predecessors simply were not. Just because something has been around for thousands of years doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there aren&amp;rsquo;t many new discoveries to be had. Hell, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until a couple of decades ago that people picked up on the fact that you &lt;em>don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> have to knead the dough to make great bread. Sometimes little things like this go undiscovered because no one bothered to look.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only very recently in history has certain technology become available to us that has allowed us to exert super precise control over the baking environment (e.g. ambient temperatures, steam, etc.) and ingredients (e.g. varieties of grain, grinds, flour blends, strains of yeast). Bread keeps getting better and better because some bakers continue to tinker endlessly with these variables. New scientific analysis could herald a &amp;ldquo;golden age of fermentation.&amp;rdquo; Sure, not everyone cares about these things. For most people, bread is bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a baker, you should remove ego from your &lt;em>mise en place&lt;/em>, rethink your take on baking, and do some researching and discovering for new techniques and skills. There&amp;rsquo;s always room for improvement. And maybe, just maybe, you could find some new excitement, or get your mind blown, and impart that joy and passion through your baking. Every person that eats your bakes deserves that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been baking my whole life. My mom never baked bread, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t eat much bread growing up. I actually loathed baking for most of my life &amp;ndash; kneading or using a dough mixer (another thing you have to wash) is absolutely tedious, and handling raw ingredients like eggs is totally disgusting. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/harpys-lovesong/">my first taste of artisan sourdough bread&lt;/a> until 2014. In fact, I didn&amp;rsquo;t discover breadmaking until ~2019, well after the &amp;ldquo;tech bros&amp;rdquo; had invaded the sourdough trend and maybe even moved on, and after &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/bread-makes-a-comeback">&lt;em>The New Yorker&lt;/em> declared&lt;/a> a comeback for bread and greeted it as the giddy limit of fake trendspotting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was initially drawn to breadmaking because of the science behind it &amp;ndash; the microbiology and cellular gastronomy &amp;ndash; more than the intuitive part. To me, sourdough brought bread back from the dead. Now I&amp;rsquo;m more enthused about transforming different grains into good bread. It&amp;rsquo;s not about making disruptive breads, but making breads that I really like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Tech bros invading sourdough&amp;rdquo; is not some panic-inducing mass-epidemic of nerds suddenly swarming every supermarket by the thousands for artisan flours and baking tools. ~4 years in, I&amp;rsquo;m still the only person I know who makes bread on a regular basis. Many types of people all over the world are getting more interested in breadmaking and trying it out, but it&amp;rsquo;s still pretty rare for someone to commit to it at the same level as myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a side note, I think the fact that producing some common food item at home is now seen as &amp;ldquo;novel&amp;rdquo; speaks volumes about how removed we postmodern humans are from our food. Tovala and DoorDash are good examples.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My second experiment with Joaquin Oro (shared by friends at the California Wheat Commission) pushes the limits of dough hydration. Gorging the Joaquin Oro grown in water-scarce California with an absurd amount of water is quite the California conundrum.&lt;/p>

&lt;td>tallow (home-rendered), softened&lt;/td>
&lt;td>10%&lt;/td>
&lt;td>37.5g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>The process is built upon my previous &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/aquaboogie-van-wheatsworth/">wholegrain &lt;em>pan de cristal&lt;/em> loaves&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Autolyse the flour at 80% hydration for 2 hours in the fridge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the poolish, levain, and azuki bean purée. Mix until well incorporated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Double hydration: Slowly drizzle in 2/3 of the remaining water, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgz0oAhgwyg">Rubaud-mix&lt;/a> until thoroughly absorbed. This requires a bit of patience, so take your time. Cover the dough and let it rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the salt, and mix well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Triple hydration: Slowly add the rest of the water, while &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgz0oAhgwyg">Rubaud-mixing&lt;/a> until completely combined. Let the dough rest for another 20 minutes at room temperature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gently mix in the olive oil and softened tallow. Let the dough rest and relax for 30 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bulk ferment the dough at ~70°F for 4 hours, performing a coil-fold every 30 minutes during the first 2.5 hours. Folding a super-high-hydration dough like this kinda feels like handling water.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transfer the dough into a fridge and retard for 12 hours.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take the dough out of the fridge; divide it into two or leave it whole as a large loaf. Let it rest at room temperature for 2-3 hours (no shaping necessary).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bake as usual: 25-30 minutes at 350°F.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I divided the dough into two approximately equal portions, baked one in the toaster oven, and kept the other one in the fridge for another 8 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="bake-1">Bake #1&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The 1st piece turned out great &amp;ndash; exactly what I had expected from a hard red spring wheat.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The crumb is delightfully light and airy, almost like gossamer; it&amp;rsquo;s exceptionally soft and chewy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The crust is so thin and crisp that it&amp;rsquo;s almost non-existent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have Tartine bread&amp;rsquo;s shell of blistered mahogany, but the interior is so chewy and preternaturally moist that it shimmers in the light.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The delicate, nutty flavor of whole wheat Joaquin Oro shines through &amp;ndash; perceptibly different from Turkey Red to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like this &lt;em>pan de San Joaquín&lt;/em> toasted; topped with &lt;em>salsa roja&lt;/em>, crunchy lettuce and thinly-sliced Vadalia onions (for a pleasing texture contrast), and crumbled &lt;em>queso fresco&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="bake-2">Bake #2&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Instead of baking the 20-hour retarded piece in an oven, I brought it to a Mardi Gras BBQ thingy and cooked it in a cast-iron skillet on a charcoal-fired grill. Who says February is a month to simply be endured &amp;ndash; a penance to pay before late winter yields to spring?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Magic happens when meat meets charcoal smoke. What about breads?&lt;/p>

alt="Joaquin Oro pan de San Joaquín baked"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I tossed a handful of black walnut and pistachio shells into the grill towards the end. Nut shells release a great smokey aroma when they burn, due to the oils that naturally occur in the shells. They burn pretty easily and add a marvelous boost of smoky sweetness to food.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This grilled &lt;em>pan de San Joaquín&lt;/em> delivers an exciting punch of smoky char in first bite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crumb is wonderfully airy and springy like the first one, and the subtle tang of the bread becomes more pronounced with each successive bite, finishing on a question mark instead of an exclamation point.&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>TL;DR&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Joaquin Oro is an excellent bread wheat for sourdough baking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t need a San Francisco sourdough starter to make excellent bread.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>I first got to know California as an undergraduate student on the East Coast, during academic conference trips to the sun-baked campus of the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) where I met my besties; and later as a part-time L-Alien (or Angeleno).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the rest of America were academic articles, then California would be something like blog posts. The former are often plodding and obtuse, and frequently more concerned with avoiding errors than trying to communicate incisive ideas; the latter may be fuzzy, loosely-defined, or outright mistaken, but tolerable so long as they introduce fresh ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wq-S8CIU7VA" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>To say California is unlike the other 49 states in the US is an understatement. Not just that the Golden State has waaaay more sculpted, sun-bronzed, rich techies with a higher propensity to consume expensive artisan coffees. To this day, I still feel a distinct difference whenever I go to California or do business in the state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>California&amp;rsquo;s economy is massive, but two industries dominate popular imagination and exert impact on a global scale: Tech in Silicon Valley/San Francisco, and entertainment in Hollywood/Los Angeles. Far less than 1% of all new startups and movie stars actually break out every year, but those who do achieve exponential success.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In a country of immigrants, California seems to be &lt;em>the&lt;/em> state of immigrants. Not just that California&amp;rsquo;s population is the most diverse in the US, with no race or ethnic group constituting a majority. About a century and a half ago, California was flooded with serial migrants who came from the East Coast and were willing to decamp once more in search of gold or fame. Does this make California the most American of all states?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Thinking back, I realize California embodies more of the &amp;ldquo;top line&amp;rdquo; mindset while New York is dominated by the &amp;ldquo;bottom line&amp;rdquo; mindset. In California, venture capital and movie studios try to pick a few outsized winners that makes their losses irrelevant. New York is complicated, obviously finance-driven, and exemplified by the prevalence of insurance in particular.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Insurers apply the law of large numbers to predict the probability and cost of &amp;ldquo;tail events.&amp;rdquo; The insurance business is about collecting a steady stream of revenue (on the liabilities side) without making catastrophic mistakes that wipe out the assets, i.e. picking up nickels in front of a steamroller. Naturally, insurers spend 80% of their time on &amp;ldquo;the losers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In contrast, venture capital focuses on maximizing &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@quantvc/power-laws-in-venture-capital-why-the-long-tail-matters-22e057c6fa34">fat tails&lt;/a>, by &amp;ldquo;investing in maybe 7 or 8 promising companies from which you think you can get a 10x return&amp;rdquo; (Peter Thiel). Successful VCs spend 80% of their time on a tiny handful of big &amp;ldquo;winners.&amp;rdquo; Their return curves look more like highly skewed power law distributions (&amp;ldquo;the 80/20 curve&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finding home runs and avoiding catastrophes are very different activities and require different mindsets. Maybe that distinction partly explains why California and New York feel so vastly different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Subsequently, winner-take-all effects and blockbuster dynamics have continually permeated the Golden State.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="california-optimism">California optimism&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For nearly a century, California offered ordinary people better lives than they could lead perhaps anywhere else in the world. Sunsets in California are always so singularly beautiful on TV and in movies. No doubt, California is the land of sunny optimism; the Conference Board&amp;rsquo;s California Consumer Confidence Index averaged 113 in the 5 years before Covid, hotter than national baselines.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I think people who grew up in California have more tolerance for apocalyptic notions. However, mixed up with this tolerance for apocalyptic notions in which the world is going to end dramatically is this belief that the world can’t help but get better and better. It’s really hard for me to believe that everything doesn’t improve, because thinking like that was just so much a part of being in California.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Joan Didion&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Optimism is a valuable form of human capital. Just look at &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Japan vs. China&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People want optimism. They don&amp;rsquo;t want to learn that it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to make it, that few do, and that even worse it takes years of hard work and dedication and a ton of luck &amp;ndash; and that today even the most talented don&amp;rsquo;t always succeed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every now and then, you detect a faint strain of melancholy, a sort of &lt;em>ennui&lt;/em>, that permeates Californians' creative output. You hear it in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU0BOyQRjWM">The Beach Boys&lt;/a> (a rock band instrumental in popularizing a particular California culture of sun, sand, and surfing in the 1960s) and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOOiY0bgrlU">Red Hot Chili Peppers&lt;/a>; see it in &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3783958/">&lt;em>La La Land&lt;/em>&lt;/a> (where Los Angeles in the winter and summer scenes looks identical) and &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4687880/">&lt;em>Goliath&lt;/em>&lt;/a>; &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/california-books">read it&lt;/a> in Philip K. Dick, Joan Didion, Jack Kerouac, John Steinbeck, etc. What do people have to worry about in the land of sunny beaches and beautiful weather?&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_zz0JNhujE" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>As a matter of fact, California&amp;rsquo;s net migration has been negative in the last two decades, losing about a million more people than it gained through migration. Instead of moving from Oklahoma to California (à la John Steinbeck&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>The Grapes of Wrath&lt;/em>), traffic has been reversing the other way. This trend has become even more evident in the last few months; when rent is $4k-$5k, making six figures in an industry experiencing mass layoffs is not a comfy situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While tech and entertainment are monstrous sectors with far-reaching impact (even reindeer herders in the arctic forests of Karelia watch Hollywood movies and use Instagram, for instance), altogether they generate only ~10% of the state&amp;rsquo;s GDP (though one could argue for a bigger share under different definitions). The two big blockbuster industries may not have that big of an impact on the daily lives of most Californians.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe that helps to explain a bit of the melancholy in the culture &amp;ndash; a golden age for all has &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220517070336/https://isteve.blogspot.com/2009/06/benjamin-schwarzs-laments-end-of.html">passed&lt;/a> and those who were once ahead have tried to lock in their gains.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But you can never leave&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ndash; Eagles, &amp;ldquo;Hotel California&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Maybe the California Dream is more elusive than we believe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe nothing exemplifies this better than wheat, whose golden age ended ~130 years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="california-wheat">California wheat&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Today, California is a leading producer in &lt;a href="https://asmith.ucdavis.edu/news/we-grow-that">pretty much everything&lt;/a> except for, curiously, the major grains like wheat and corn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wheat was brought to California from Mexico; it was first grown by padres during the &amp;ldquo;mission period&amp;rdquo; in the 18th century and later by settlers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>California became the nation&amp;rsquo;s second largest wheat producer (after Minnesota) in the second half of the 19th century, thanks to the Gold Rush and the associated increased demand for food. Wheat production in California hit a peak in the late 1880s; soon thereafter, it declined as rapidly as it rose, mainly due to soil exhaustion and low farm prices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With increasing acreage of irrigated land and better transportation to markets in the eastern US, California began a massive agricultural shift &amp;ndash; diversifying away from grains and towards the more lucrative &lt;a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/scbgp/specialty-crop">specialty crops&lt;/a> like vegetables, fruit, and nuts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By 1913, California&amp;rsquo;s wheat-planting area had shrunk to 380,000 acres (from some 3 million acres just three decades earlier). Throughout the 20th century, the wheat acreage fluctuated widely, ranging from a minimum of 270,000 acres in 1966 to a maximum of 1,345,000 acres in 1981. In recent years, the wheat acreage has stabilized somewhat, averaging about half a million acres since the year &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->2000&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->; wheat production averages ~40 million bushels annually. (In comparison, Kansas plants ~7 million acres of wheat annually on average and produces over 300 million bushels.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wheat didn&amp;rsquo;t disappear from California; it still is an important rotational crop for many growers, and California&amp;rsquo;s wheat industry is a bit unique.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>While Kansas specializes in &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/hard-red-winter-wheat/">hard red winter wheat&lt;/a>, North Dakota in &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/hard-red-spring-wheat/">hard red spring wheat&lt;/a> and durum, and Washington in &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/tags/soft-white-winter-wheat/">soft white wheat&lt;/a>, California grows all of the US wheat classes except soft red, i.e. you can find hard red, hard white, soft white, and durum wheat grown across the state. The two main types of wheat grown in California are &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->hard red winter wheat&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and durum wheat, mainly used for milling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given the vast expanse of the state, most of California&amp;rsquo;s wheat production is localized in specific regions. The majority of wheat is grown in the San Joaquin Valley, where Fresno, Kern, Kings and Tulare counties dominate production. (Yolo County in the Sacramento Valley completes the list of the top 5 counties with the largest area harvested.) Eternal sunshine, coupled with a warm and dry climate, produces big plump kernels with low moisture content, consistent kernel size distribution, and high test weight.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that California&amp;rsquo;s wheat yield has been among the highest in the nation. California also happens to have the largest milling capacity in the US, thanks to having the most mills in one state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Artisan bakers and organic farmers are leading the revival of whole grains and local grain economies. While wheat breeding programs often focus on refined flour markets, UC Davis recently started an organic wheat breeding program to focus on unique wheat varieties for artisan breadmaking and local grain markets. The awesome team (a shout-out to Claudia Carter and Teng Vang) at the California Wheat Commission &amp;ndash; the coolest wheat commission in the country, by the way &amp;ndash; sent me a few of such varieties to experiment with.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The first California-grown wheat that I experimented with was &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/breadford-von-regrainton">Glenn&lt;/a>, a modern hard red spring variety grown by Kenter Canyon Farms along the south side of the Santa Clara River.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week, I got to play with &lt;strong>Joaquin Oro&lt;/strong>, another California-grown hard red spring wheat. It&amp;rsquo;s a modern cultivar selected from the OG Joaquin variety for morphological, agronomic and quality traits; bred and developed by WestBred to thrive in the wheat-growing areas of the San Joaquin Valley; and released by UC Davis in 2011. Protein content ~14%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Historically, Joaquin Oro has been the highest-quality bread wheat variety grown in California. It&amp;rsquo;s also one of the highest-rated whole wheat flours by the California Wheat Commission test lab.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="Joaquin Oro wheat berries, from California."/>&lt;figcaption class="right">&lt;p>Plump and vibrant Joaquin Oro wheat berries, grown in the San Joaquin Valley of California.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This Joaquin Oro was grown by Jon Eck of Eck Farms in Merced County, California. Jon&amp;rsquo;s parents are lifelong farmers, growing primarily almonds and sweet potatoes &amp;ndash; two of the traditional cash crops in the San Joaquin Valley. Jon decided to try growing grain as a rotational crop at the suggestion of a baker friend. John tells of his experience and learning on the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.thesourdoughpodcast.com/episodes/2021/9/27/jon-eck-california-wheat-grower">Sourdough Podcast&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing I noticed with Joaquin Oro was how easily the wheat berries milled to a fine texture on the first run, on a countertop electric WonderMill set to Bread Flour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wholegrain Joaquin Oro flour has a finer, smoother texture (and visibly smaller bran particle size) than freshly milled Turkey Red &amp;ndash; and almost boasts of a Unifine feel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe this is what a French miller would classify as &lt;em>blé tendre&lt;/em> (&amp;ldquo;soft wheat&amp;rdquo;), a bread wheat that shows little &lt;em>résistance&lt;/em> to milling (i.e. requires less force than &lt;em>le blé résistant&lt;/em> to shear the starchy endosperm of the grain).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite being categorized as a &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; wheat in the US commercial wheat classification system due to its high protein content, Joaquin Oro actually mills quite easily &amp;ndash; like a low-protein wheat. I am amazed.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>My first experiment with Joaquin Oro is inspired by my &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/dulce-locura/">&lt;em>pain d&amp;rsquo;épices au levain&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, in light of the upcoming Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day. It incorporates strawberries, rosehips, spiced syrup, and dark chocolate. 🌹🍓🍫&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to bolt the freshly milled Joaquin Oro to remove some of the coarsest bran bits and midds, to lighten the load a bit on the gluten in the flour, which shall hold together a boatloat of add-ins. The extracted bits will be used, instead of flour, to dust the workbench and the dough later, so nothing is wasted.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Did you know California is America&amp;rsquo;s largest producer of strawberries? And wild rose (&lt;em>Rosa californica&lt;/em>) grows throughout the coast and foothills of the state?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are a forager and happen to have collected some wild rosehips and strawberries from Nature&amp;rsquo;s grocery store, you are a hell of &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->a lucky bastard&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Otherwise, grab some dried rosehips and good-tasting strawberries from somewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make the strawberry rosehip purée 🍓🌹 at home: Boil the rosehips in just enough water until soft; push the pulp through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the seeds and irritating hairs; run the resulting pulp and juice with strawberries (fresh or frozen) in a blender into a smooth purée. Use as much rosehips or strawberries as you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pro tip: Make your own &lt;em>sirop d&amp;rsquo;épices&lt;/em> (spiced syrup), too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then proceed as documented in the &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/dulce-locura/">&lt;em>pain d&amp;rsquo;épices au levain&lt;/em>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TL;DR, give the dough an overnight bulk fermentation in the fridge, after a series of coil-folds in the initial 4.5 hours; shape; final proof 3-4 hours; bake off.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Joaquin Oro delivers a nuanced flavor profile. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have as much bitterness as many red wheat varieties; instead it&amp;rsquo;s imbued with nutty, malty notes. This pairs exquisitely with the rich fruitiness and faint tartness of rosehips and strawberries. Homemade &lt;em>sirop d&amp;rsquo;épices&lt;/em> cranks up the sweetness and adds a wonderful touch of spice notes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Joaquin Oro also performs excellently in baking. The dough felt quite elastic during the initial fermentation, and became very pillowy and delicate after overnight cold retard; it showed a pretty decent rise in the oven.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The crust of this bread turned out crisp and thin; the crumb tender and springy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The chewy texture reminded me of a traditional stottie cake in Northumberland, northern England. Irresistible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go make this bread and share with your sweetheart, Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day or not, and enjoy it with a good slather of chocolate cheese fudge &amp;ndash; while everyone is getting worked up about Joe Rogan again or Kansas City Chiefs winning another Super Bowl after being underdogs for half a century.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The current &lt;a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20230131_12/">unemployment rate in Japan&lt;/a> is 2.5%. Japanese millennials get to enjoy a fairly tight labor market, which means they ought to choose which company to work for. But few of them have an interest in switching employers or jobs, because they rank perfect stability above high wages. This risk aversion is usually attributed to lingering fears of the previous downturn. The country that lost a decade &amp;ndash; or two &amp;ndash; has fostered a generation of youth highly averse to risk-taking. Optimism is &lt;a href="https://archive.is/vqIPO">in very short supply&lt;/a> in Japan. On the other hand, surveys show the Chinese are much more optimistic about the future. Take Cixin Liu&amp;rsquo;s sci-fi series, &lt;em>Three Body Problem&lt;/em>, for an example. The novel is driven by a fundamentally optimistic vision: It asks why aliens should not be 10,000x more advanced than humans, instead of portraying a typical alien civilization that&amp;rsquo;s only 50%-70% more advanced than humans.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Most varieties grown in California are genetically spring wheat (planted in the spring and harvested in late summer or early fall). However, since the majority of California wheat-growing regions have very mild winters, spring wheat can be sown in the fall or early winter like winter wheat. Wheat market classifications are typically based on the season of production rather than growth habit, which is why California&amp;rsquo;s red wheat production is referred to as hard red winter wheat.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

Google claims oranges provide 53 mg vitamin C per 100 g.

Over the last decade, being able to experience Noma has apparently become a status symbol. Funny how the culinary icon was &lt;em>forced&lt;/em> to shut down after it found itself facing financial difficulties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In October 2021, Noma &amp;ndash; arguably the most prestigious kitchen in the world &amp;ndash; started paying its interns (known as &lt;em>stagiaires&lt;/em>) for the first time. And that has added $50,000 to the restaurant&amp;rsquo;s monthly operating expenses, according to the NYT.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Rene Redzepi, chef-owner of Noma, said Monday that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible to make the math of fine dining work for his almost 100 employees and himself. &amp;hellip; In 2021, the restaurant lost money, even with government support, while selling $700 lunches.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Kate Krader, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://archive.is/JTOuA">Noma, One of the World’s Best Restaurants, Is Closing Its Doors&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, Bloomberg&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>According to an &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/files/Noma-offentliggorelse.pdf">annual report&lt;/a>, Noma received 🇩🇰 kr10.9 million (USD ~$1.57m) in Covid-19 compensation from the Danish government in 2021 while booking a net &lt;em>loss&lt;/em> of 🇩🇰 kr1.69 million (USD ~$240k); the previous year, it received 🇩🇰 kr8.05 million (USD ~$1.16m) in government financial aid and recorded a tiny profit of 🇩🇰 kr39,816 (USD ~$5,748).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, one pays USD ~$500/person to eat a weeknight dinner soberly at Noma. The restaurant can seat ~42 diners comfortably. Let&amp;rsquo;s say 20 people dine at Noma every night Tues-Fri and 20 at Saturday lunch. $500 x 20 ppl x 5 days = $50,000/week in gross revenue (not even counting beverages), or &amp;gt;=$200k per month. If Noma is fully booked every day, it would make at least $105k/week, &amp;gt;=$440k a month, or &amp;gt;= $5m a year. And that&amp;rsquo;s just a baseline projection. $50,000/month in labor cost for ~100 employees = $500/month for each worker!!! 😱😨😳😱😱 Can you survive on that anywhere in the developed world?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If &amp;ldquo;the world&amp;rsquo;s most influential restaurant&amp;rdquo; that brings in &lt;em>at least&lt;/em> a quarter million USD in gross revenue each freakin' month can&amp;rsquo;t keep its doors open while paying its workers a meager wage of $500/month, then this industry at large has some major restructuring and soul-searching to do. Numbers don&amp;rsquo;t lie.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Finnish chef Kim Mikkola, who worked at Noma for four years, said that fine dining, like diamonds, ballet and other elite pursuits, often has abuse built into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Everything luxetarian is built on somebody’s back; somebody has to pay,” he said.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to mourn Noma&amp;rsquo;s closure, because there is no part of me that feels something is being lost or taken away. And no, I&amp;rsquo;ve never dined at Noma, so I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how life-changing a Noma meal was. I did read &lt;em>The Noma Guide to Fermentation&lt;/em> a few years ago and tried making the rye bread miso (&amp;ldquo;ryeso&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m glad Noma existed and René Redzepi realized a business that exploits unpaid labor is unsustainable, financially and morally. I hope the next restaurant that rises to influence global cuisine as much as Noma did will be a pioneer in some sort of real sustainability, not just propelled by fanaticism around a singular genius or its &lt;a href="https://theworld.org/stories/2012-04-08/fascist-food-fight">avant-garde fascism&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The truth is, however elaborately prepared or miraculously transformed, at the end of the day it&amp;rsquo;s just food &amp;ndash; something that you swallow and inevitably becomes shit. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s what made Anthony Bourdain so depressed.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A lot of things are upside-down in the brave new Po-Lo (post-lockdown) world. Expensive fine dining as we know it seems to be &lt;a href="https://robbreport.com/paid-issue/death-fine-dining/">on its way out&lt;/a>. In fact, another destination for fine dining (in Silicon Valley), &lt;a href="https://sf.eater.com/2022/11/7/23444965/manresa-closing-reservations">Manresa&lt;/a>, closed in late 2022.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am reminded of &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9764362/">&lt;em>The Menu&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. The movie takes place mostly inside Hawthorne, a fictional uber-luxurious restaurant on a small island that seats only a dozen customers a night at $1,250/person. Workers are stuck between the belief that what they are doing (i.e. passionately pursuing their dreams) is worth sacrificing everything for and the reality that they have surrendered their lives to grueling service work which the monied class treats as merely social status accessories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is something strange about real life &amp;ndash; you can feel so plugged in and so distant at the same time. You want to be part of the action, but you find yourself on the outside. And then, if you get close enough, you realize that the main goal of so many on the inside is to keep you out, and to make you think they know something that you do not, which is patently untrue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Towards the end of &lt;em>The Menu&lt;/em>, Chef Slowik pours his heart and soul into making Margot a good old-fashioned cheeseburger, because he sees it as an opportunity to redeem himself from his failure to stay true to his art and make up for all the passionless meals he prepared for the rich. When Margot takes a bite and appreciates the burger for what it is &amp;ndash; a filling meal that satiates her hunger &amp;ndash; the chef finally feels proud and content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This burger reminds me of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz9z_Q7ced8">&lt;em>lablabi&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, a working-class staple in Tunisia. To make &lt;em>lablabi&lt;/em>, you basically pour a thin soup with boiled chickpeas over a pile of stale bread that&amp;rsquo;s torn up into tiny pieces. &lt;em>Lablabi&lt;/em> is cheap, quick, and filling; it fuels you for the rest of the day and keeps you warm during the winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the other end of the dining spectrum is &lt;a href="https://www.danperlman.net/1999/07/11/white-trash-dinner/">&amp;ldquo;trailer trash food&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, stuff that I imagine the main character in Barbara Kingsolver&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Demon Copperhead&lt;/em> grew up eating. I haven&amp;rsquo;t forgotten the shock I experienced when I first encountered the &lt;a href="https://www.thelunchbelle.com/recipes-1/2010/12/1/recipe-white-trash-ambrosia.html">ambrosia&lt;/a> at a working-class eatery in South Carolina: canned fruits were mixed with canned whipped cream, mayonnaise, sugar, and mini marshmallows, and topped with Cool Whip. It&amp;rsquo;s apparently a Southern holiday tradition. (The OG ambrosia made in the 1800s used only 3 ingredients: orange slices, grated coconut, and sugar.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A friend of mine recently went to Italy on vacation and brought me a &lt;em>panforte di Siena&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; a traditional Italian confection that&amp;rsquo;s a cross between fruitcake, candy, and &lt;em>Lebkuchen&lt;/em>. Basically, a dense, sweet &amp;ldquo;cake&amp;rdquo; made from candied fruits, nuts, spices, a touch of flour, and a sugar/honey syrup, dusted in powdered sugar on all sides. It tastes absolutely delicious, but far too sweet for me. I wanted to make a less sweet version with pretty much the same ingredients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I stumbled across &lt;a href="http://www.farine-mc.com/2012/02/hutzelbrot-with-dried-cherries-and.html">&lt;em>hutzelbrot&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, looked into it further, and fell down a &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%BCchtebrot">rabbit hole&lt;/a>&amp;hellip; Eric Carle&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://eric-carle.com/eric-carle-book-gallery/the-very-hungry-caterpillar-1969/">hungry caterpillar&lt;/a> ate &lt;em>das Früchtebrot&lt;/em>??&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Hutzelbrot&lt;/em> is a German fruit bread, originally made with dried pears (called &amp;ldquo;hutzeln&amp;rdquo; in Alemannisch), but it gained many regional names as well &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;zelten&amp;rdquo; (Bolzano), &amp;ldquo;schnitzbrot&amp;rdquo; (Schwaben), &amp;ldquo;birnebrot&amp;rdquo; (Das Allgäu), &amp;ldquo;kletzenbrot&amp;rdquo; (Bavaria-Austria) or simply the more generic &amp;ldquo;früchtebrot&amp;rdquo; as it can be filled any dried fruits other than pears.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the old days, the stingy farmers' wives would dry the leftover pears to avoid food waste and make the &lt;em>hutzelbrot&lt;/em> on St. Thomas' day, December 21st (the winter solstice). The wives and maids would embrace their pear trees, with their hands and arms still covered in dough, to ensure a good harvest in the following year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing beats ye olde traditional recipe. From &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%BCchtebrot">Wikipedia&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Originally Früchtebrot was made without honey, brown sugar or white sugar, with the sweetness coming only from the dried pears. Equally uncommon is Früchtebrot made of wheat dough. Using wheat dough makes the bread look less rustic, but also hinders the combustion of the fruits baked into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So, it&amp;rsquo;s the medieval OG energy bar &amp;ndash; just dried fruits, nuts and a touch of rye flour!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>An 18th-century manuscript describes celteno, a predecessor of Zelten. The recipe reads: &amp;ldquo;Take some Candia grapes, raisins, pine nuts, peeled almonds cut long, minutely cut lemon peel, aniseed seeds, candied citron, cinnamon powder, a little sugar, and a little flour and mix everything together. Take a small piece of brewer&amp;rsquo;s yeast, the size of a walnut&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The internet shows me many kinds of &lt;em>das Früchtebrot&lt;/em>, which roughly fall into two categories:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>yeast-leavened breads, such as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMtdyZAjq3U">this früchtebrot&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDgT6aqO9wc">Kletzenbrot aus der ländlichen Küche&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v5Rzz73qhY">Schnitzbrot&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://heissehimbeeren.com/das-saftigste-original-fruechtebrot-rezept-von-oma/">grandma&amp;rsquo;s original Früchtebrot&lt;/a> (with rye flour). The yeasted dough usually goes through a first rise, before mixing with rehydrated dried fruits and nuts. The dough can barely enrobe the huge amount of add-ins, and acts more like a binder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>quick breads with baking powder, such as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t0bCzNaBfA">saftiges Früchtebrot&lt;/a> and &lt;em>Apfelbrot&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Marcel Paa&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.marcelpaa.com/rezepte/fruechtebrot">Früchtebrot-Powerbrot&lt;/a> uses a yeasted wholegrain preferment and a sourdough levain, similar to Peter Reinhardt&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Taking a page from all of the above, I started my heretical experiment a few days ago.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This bread turned out superbly moist and dense, like a liquidy Lärabar. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe the knife came out clean! The scald worked out marvelously as a binder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First bite reminded me of a cocoa banana bread, which is weird because there was absolutely no banana or cocoa in it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s definitely not as decadent as &lt;em>il panforte di Siena&lt;/em>, but plenty sweet enough for me (I could eat 2 small slices at most in one sitting). I would definitely put a lot more nuts into it next time, and maybe reduce the amount of fruits.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Stanley Ginsberg has a recipe for &lt;em>zelten&lt;/em> in &lt;em>The Rye Baker&lt;/em>. No mention that it&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;em>hutzelbrot&lt;/em> by a different name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today is MLK Day in the US &amp;ndash; a federal holiday. I was looking for grains on some Swedish &lt;em>net butiker&lt;/em> this morning, and popped into a farm store statically built with Hugo (like this site you are reading right now). That&amp;rsquo;s a first and a breath of fresh air, given the virtually unassailable dominance by Shopify and Squarespace in e-commerce. It made me feel hopeful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about an anime I watched a long time ago &amp;ndash; &lt;em>Shinsekai yori&lt;/em> (新世界より / From the New World).&lt;/p>

Realtors are trying to lure people in with a roadside ad, &amp;ldquo;Enjoyed the park? Why not live here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was just complaining the other day about how we had to drive increasingly longer and longer distances these days to get to a truly wild and natural park. More and more green space has been rezoned for residential housing development. Oftentimes I feel mankind has essentially been running a giant Ponzi scheme with Nature &amp;ndash; who might be &lt;a href="https://peaksurfer.blogspot.com/2022/12/who-is-sam-bankman-fried-of.html">the SBF of the ecological space&lt;/a>?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A person deals with the natural elements only through a set of technologies which is so complete that he is actually dealing with those technologies themselves. The natural environment itself disappears. We obviously have to make a comparison with the city, an essential product of technology. In the city, man perceives the natural elements only accidentally (parks, sidewalk trees). Nothing spontaneously natural is left here. And outside nature is reserved for spare time, relaxation, etc., given the decreasing importance of agriculture and the decline in the farming population.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Home prices have been falling&amp;hellip; 1 out of 3 real estate agents in the US couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to pay rent in November. But when you go to Zillow and actually check the price history of almost any house on the market right now, you will see that current price drop looks like &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/files/Kovach-statement.pdf">a pimple on an elephant&amp;rsquo;s ass&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo; The only good news is downpayment requirements are falling, too. Still, total cost of home ownership over a 25-year amortization is significantly higher. Few are advertising that fact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some quick mortgage math for Canadians: a C$1.5m mortgage at 3% APR with a 25-year amortization is C$86,141/year (C$2,151,545 total cost). A C$1.1m mortgage at 7% APR with a 25-year amortization is C$94,391/year (C$2,359,789 total cost). Housing prices need to drop a lot more.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Pending Home Sales in the United States decreased 37.80% year-on-year in November of 2022, the 18th straight month of declines and the biggest since November of 2021.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A ramification: Private Equity (PE) is going to see a massive write-down of its non-public assets in 2023, whether it&amp;rsquo;s residential real estate (RRE), commercial real estate (CRE), or venture capital (VC). Blackstone&amp;rsquo;s $68Bn &lt;a href="https://www.breit.com/portfolio/">BREIT&lt;/a> and Starwood&amp;rsquo;s $30Bn &lt;a href="https://www.starwoodnav.reit/portfolio/">SREIT&lt;/a> already froze withdrawals last month. This past week, BREIT got a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230103005410/en/UC-Investments-Creates-Strategic-Venture-with-Blackstone-to-Invest-4-Billion-in-BREIT-Common-Shares">$4Bn &amp;ldquo;Buffett-style&amp;rdquo; last-resort bailout&lt;/a> from the University of California. Given that Blackstone is the world largest institutional landlord, 2023 is off to an ominous start for the US CRE market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Markdowns will be severe. This will lead to groupthink of re-evaluating the entire PE world. Not all PE is bad, but the decade-long pyramiding of real estate on ever lower interest rates has ended &amp;ndash; and that will bring a big markdown cycle. Opportunity always exists when the crowd thinks it knows an unknowable future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another surprise file will be the Pension Fund Bailout Act of 2023. The City of Chicago is the poster child for this phenomenon, but they are not alone. Pension Funds (PFs) have been gouging on PE and RE over the last decade. That horse is now dead, as the return of real interest rates and above-zero commercial papers crushes the valuations of these investments. Slowly at first, and then all of a sudden, the markdowns will rip holes in the PF balance sheets. The fact that the bulk of the boomers are now retiring is not going to help these PFs. (The tight labor market is partly due to early retirements.) As this pull-forward effect ripples through the PF world, more problems will surface and the cry for a bailout will intensify. Good luck to the bond market and RE market when the buyer from the last decade is now a seller. Prepare for &amp;ldquo;higher for longer&amp;rdquo; in the interest rate world as the demand for commercial papers drops &amp;ndash; especially in a negative-carry world. The current bond yield curve is toxic for leveraged financial positions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of ridiculous things happened in the last couple of years, e.g. cars launched into space for the memes, degenerates becoming millionaires overnight from their basement and then giving it all back. As the calendar turns to 2023, all those moments will be lost in time, like tears in the rain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Dominoes are starting to fall, e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/01/05/silvergate-stock-crashes-nearly-50-as-bank-grapples-with-crypto-crisis/">Silvergate&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.amny.com/transit/ag-james-sues-auto-lender-credit-acceptance-corp-accuses-of-predatory-loans-and-securities-fraud/">Credit Acceptance Corporation&lt;/a> this past week. Bed Bath and Beyond is worried about &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/05/business/bed-bath-beyond-bankruptcy.html">a gloomier future&lt;/a>. &amp;ldquo;Slowly at first, then all of a sudden.&amp;rdquo; Second-tier financial institutions and sovereigns will be the trigger. The higher cost of capital is starting to filter into the financial economy, driving valuations lower and lower.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The layoffs in Tech Land are &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/05/amazon-to-cut-18000-jobs-as-tech-layoffs-continue/">just getting started&lt;/a>, as the seemingly unending stream of capital supporting profitless Ponzi tech is drying up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There has been too much money in finance and tech. There are some who can resist, but not many. Plenty of Harvard grads went on to Wall Street. What a waste. You need enough money to live, but how much is that? Which is precisely the point of &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15255876/">&lt;em>Emily the Criminal&lt;/em>&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; Emily needs the money and she makes choices. The middle class has evaporated. And the truth is those at the bottom will do anything to survive. Desperate people do desperate things. Emily says you must make your own rules. You are either the boss or the employee (capital vs. labor). If you are the employee, you don&amp;rsquo;t have much power. Sure, there are unions. Then again, everybody agrees to arbitration and the company always wins and&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Life is hard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet people can still splurge $140 on a dozen &lt;a href="https://lastcrumb.com/">luxury cookies&lt;/a> and $100 on a single panettone. First-class flights from Zurich to Singapore are fully booked. Channel 2.55 bag went from $1600 in 2008 to $9000 in 2022. More draining in the financial ecosystem is on tap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11564570/">&lt;em>Glass Onion&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, Benoit Blanc eventually figures out that the billionaire is just an idiot &amp;ndash; and he should have seen it all along.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thoroughly caffeinated, I skimmed through Micheline Maynard&amp;rsquo;s new book, &lt;em>Satisfaction Guaranteed: How Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s Built a Corner Deli into a Global Food Community&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those quintessential boomer hagiography-cum-business books. The author clearly admires Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash; almost as much as Kamala Harris publicly idolizes civil rights lawyers &amp;ndash; and keeps comparing it to the world&amp;rsquo;s most successful companies, especially Toyota; whereas I find the niche store&amp;rsquo;s business model more clichéd than inspiring. The owners' purportedly unique &amp;ldquo;Visioning&amp;rdquo; process at ZingTrain, for example, recommends that your &amp;ldquo;effective vision&amp;rdquo; be &amp;ldquo;inspiring,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;strategically sound,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;written down,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;communicated&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; four tenets that, on the whole, seem pretty stale. The same could be said about Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;12 Natural Laws of Business,&amp;rdquo; which includes such banal points as &amp;ldquo;profit is good&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;greatness takes time.&amp;rdquo; One story I find particularly intriguing is how Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/uncategorized/campus-206/">handled competition&lt;/a> (e.g. Amer&amp;rsquo;s Mediterranean Deli) in the early years, given that 1) restaurant recipes are virtually never patentable, 2) restaurants have basically no &amp;ldquo;moats&amp;rdquo;, and 3) customer loyalty is fragile, particularly during difficult times. TBH, I find Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s mail-order bread a lot fresher than this book. Michigan has historically been hit hard by national recessions because the state&amp;rsquo;s economy (still) depends heavily on the auto industry and durable goods manufacturing, despite recent efforts to diversify. It would be interesting to see what happens in this round.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are only patterns. Patterns on top of patterns. Patterns that affect other patterns. Patterns hidden by patterns. Patterns within patterns. If you watch closely, history does nothing but repeat itself. What we call chaos is just patterns we haven&amp;rsquo;t recognized. What we call random is just patterns we can&amp;rsquo;t decipher. What we call nonsense is just patterns we can&amp;rsquo;t understand. What we call gibberish is just patterns we can&amp;rsquo;t read.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="bran-levain">Bran levain&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I milled some heritage Sangaste rye (45%), Red Fife wheat (45%), and buckwheat (10%).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I bolted the freshly milled wholegrain flours to remove some course bits (~17%), which I fed to the levain (~85% hydration) in 3 increments over 14 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sifted flours came out to be ~83% extraction. Every part of the grain will be re-combined in the final dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="altus-soaker">Altus soaker&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>I mixed the sifted flours, chia and flax seeds, and the altus soaker with 85% of the water, and left the mixture to autolyze for 30 mins. Then I added the levain and salt, and mixed for a few minutes. I let the dough rest for 10 mins, before adding the rest of the water slowly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, I put the dough in the fridge. In the next 24 hours, I took the dough out of the fridge 6 times and gave it a coil-fold, adding some of the sprouted pseudo-grains, toasted seeds and raisins during each fold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a 24-hour cold fermentation in the fridge, I shaped the dough, rolled it in extra sunflower seeds, and let it proof at room temperature for 3 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly, I baked it as usual, in my toaster oven.&lt;/p>

Irresistible and toothsome.</description><content>&lt;p>The US is still a superlulz &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jit.asp">JIT&lt;/a> la la land. One bullet is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/04/1140647869/power-substations-north-carolina-gunfire-vandalism">all it takes&lt;/a> to shut down the power grid for days&amp;hellip;possibly weeks. It reminded me of Juan Zarate&amp;rsquo;s memoir, &lt;em>Treasury&amp;rsquo;s War.&lt;/em> Unlike Europe, Uncle Sam is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance. Still, it feels like a first-world country with third-world infrastructure. As much as it sucks for the people affected, we are all living in an age of energy vulnerability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been to various parts of North freakin' Carolina a number of times. Charlotte, like any other financial center, is the most boring. The Research Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill) in the heart of Piedmont is more fun. Of course, nothing beats Asheville &amp;ndash; a hipster mecca. Best memories are licking my fingers after eating N&amp;rsquo;Asheville &amp;ldquo;Mount St. Hell No&amp;rdquo; spicy crispy fried chicken at &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE5SyITVOTE">Rocky&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a>, and getting caught in a rainstorm in Wilmington on the riverwalk and roaming the beaches like a drowned rat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until recently that I learned North Carolina is the #1 producer of sweet potatoes in the US.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week I stumbled across a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/udoyzj/pain_depices_au_levain_naturally_leavened_french/">reddit&lt;/a> on &lt;em>pain d&amp;rsquo;épices au levain&lt;/em>, got sidetracked, and went down a rabbit hole. I still have a ton of sweet potatoes left over from the Gobble Gobble Day. Why not create a &lt;em>pain d&amp;rsquo;épices&lt;/em> of my own, you know, heresy style? Maybe with a North Carolina character? Forgive me, France.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="homemade-spiced-syrup">Homemade spiced syrup&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>First off, I made a simple &lt;em>sirop d&amp;rsquo;épices&lt;/em> in the Instant Pot:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>60g aged orange peels&lt;/li>
&lt;li>30g fresh ginger&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 whole star anise&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 piece 4&amp;quot; cinnamon stick&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5 cloves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 allspice berries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>10 cardamom seeds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g raisin water (soak 150g raisins in 250g water for a few hours, and squeeze out the liquid)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200g h₂o&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Pressure-cooked for 1 minute, followed by 30 minutes of natural release. Then I left it overnight, to allow the aromatics to meld together further. The sweet orangey aroma wafted through the house. Next morning, I strained the whole mixture through a through a fine-mesh sieve, and filled up 2 big jars with the thin brown goodness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This homemade syrup packs quite a punch with its fragrant combination of spices. Delightfully sweet with a deep orange flavor, and chock full of bold, brisk notes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Pro tip&lt;/code>: Instead of throwing away the leftover aromatic pulp from straining, blend it finely into a sweet fruit paste. Use it as a delicious spread on toasts, or thin it a little and use as a marinade/sauce/glaze in savory dishes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="tar-heel-blend">Tar Heel Blend&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I decided to mix up my own Tar Heel Blend wheat flour, instead of using my go-to workhorse Turkey Red.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>60% Appalachian White (Fish Pond Branch Farms, NC): a HWWW with a mild creamy taste and ~12% protein&lt;/li>
&lt;li>20% NuEast (Fish Pond Branch Farms, NC): a HRWW with a delicate nutty flavor and ~10% protein&lt;/li>
&lt;li>20% Sungold spelt (Red Tail Grains, NC): a modern cultivar of spelt with ~12% protein&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Much like Missouri, the eastern US is not hospitable to growing bread wheat, because the area&amp;rsquo;s humidity increases the incidence of disease in the fields and affects yield and quality of the grain. Historically, North Carolina has grown almost exclusively soft wheats (lower protein, better for crackers, biscuits, etc). But, in response to a growing demand from the resurgence of artisan bakeries, two modern high-yielding cultivars of hard winter wheat, Appalachian White and NuEast, were bred by NC State researchers and &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2009/ars-releases-first-hard-winter-wheat-varieties-for-eastern-us-production/">released in 2009&lt;/a> to farmers as high-quality bread wheats suited for production in the Carolinas.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While the levain is fermenting, cook the sweet potatoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want your sweet potatoes sweeter, cook them &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-mashed-sweet-potatoes-recipe">low and slow&lt;/a>, so that the enzyme will have more time to break down more starch and convert it to more maltose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I heated a pot of plain water in an Instant Pot to ~160F, and threw a few whole Carolina Ruby sweet potatoes directly into it. I covered up the pot, and let the spuds rest in the warm water bath overnight. You want to hold the sweet spuds in that 135F-170F (57C-77C) sweet spot for an extended period of time, to activate their endogenous enzymes that bring out their natural sweetness. After a few hours, you can take the sweet spuds out of the water bath, roast and mash them.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>I squished up the flour with 1/2 of the spiced syrupy water and the cooled sweet potato, and autolyzed for 2 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the autolyse, I squeezed all of the levain into the dough, while adding 1/2 of the remaining sweet water in several increments. Gave it a few rounds of slap &amp;amp; fold until it reached a semi-homogeneous texture, to make sure everything was evenly incorproated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a 20-minute rest, I squished in the salt and the rest of the sweet water. The dough looked and felt like a sticky mess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did a coil-fold every 20 minutes for the first hour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the 2h mark, I added the chocolate pieces, and gave the dough another coil-fold so that all of the chocolate bits were completely enveloped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did two more coil-folds at the 3h and 4h marks, respectively, to make sure the chocolate goodies were totally distributed throughout the dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dough started to feel puffy. I decided to stop turning it, and let it ferment, unmolested, in the sunroom overnight (~43F).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next morning, the dough had doubled in volume. I let it warm up on the kitchen counter for 2 hours. Then I shaped it into a boule and placed it in a proofing bowl, seam-side down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the surface of the dough reached ~60F, I dumped it out onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper, and baked it in the toaster oven. 350F for the first 20 minutes, and 325F for 20 more minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I let the bread cool for 4 hours before slicing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bread surrounding the little nuggets of chocolate was not bland at all! It was ever so gently sweetened by the simple syrup, like everything was magically pulled together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crumb was tender and springy, the sweetish flavor in harmony with the chocolate and spices; the crust was crispy and fabulous. Another winner for my repertoire!&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Aquaboogie di Dolce</title><link>/posts/aquaboogie-di-dolce/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 23:32:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/aquaboogie-di-dolce/</guid><description>An absurdly high-hydration summer panettone, made with 85% extraction Turkey Red and 100% extraction einkorn.</description><content>&lt;p>I just found out that Dean &amp;amp; DeLuca, one of America&amp;rsquo;s fanciest gourmet grocery store chains whose name is synonymous with NYC luxury, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200401042156/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/dean-deluca-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-from-creditors">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection&lt;/a> from creditors in April 2020. It had &amp;ldquo;liabilities of as much as $500 million and assets of no more than $50 million.&amp;rdquo; The chain&amp;rsquo;s owner, Thailand&amp;rsquo;s Pace Development Corp., defaulted on a total of THB ฿9.5Bn (USD ~$315 million) of debt in 2019.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out, it was Dean &amp;amp; DeLuca&amp;rsquo;s vendors &amp;ndash; bakeries and patisseries that supplied many of the store&amp;rsquo;s pricey gourmet products &amp;ndash; who were the first to sound the death knell of the retail chain. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/dining/dean-and-deluca-closes-stores.html">The NY Times&lt;/a> reported that 4+ NYC vendors, including Bien Cuit and Fulton Fish Market, were &amp;ldquo;owed hundreds of thousands of dollars.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such a shame the iconic brand ended up in shambles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I popped into Dean &amp;amp; DeLuca&amp;rsquo;s flagship location in NYC&amp;rsquo;s SoHo a few times when I lived in the city. Tourists are notoriously obsessed with shops in SoHo. Lol. I haven&amp;rsquo;t bothered to keep up with NYC news since I moved away years ago. I had no idea Dean &amp;amp; DeLuca opened stores in Tokyo, Bangkok, Singapore, Seoul, Dubai, Doha, Bahrain, etc. TBH, high-end stores like Dean &amp;amp; DeLuca are best for dumpster-diving.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>For many customers who stepped inside Dean &amp;amp; DeLuca over its nearly 42-year history, the visit was more about getting a glimpse of a posh world far beyond their pay grade, where a polished Thanksgiving of perfectly roasted turkey and decadent chocolate cakes could be had for the price of all the money in your bank account. Purchasing something at the stores &amp;ndash; no matter how small &amp;ndash; was a treat that made someone feel like one of the many celebrities who readily raved about shopping trips to Dean &amp;amp; DeLuca in the press. Until Whole Foods and Eataly came along, Dean &amp;amp; Deluca existed in a class of its own. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dean &amp;amp; DeLuca enjoyed a cache well into the late-aughts that was regularly documented in pop culture. In a violent scene in &lt;em>American Psycho&lt;/em>, a book about a 1980s Wall Street serial killer, main character Patrick Bateman name drops Italian sea salt purchased from Dean &amp;amp; DeLuca. Characters in shows like &lt;em>Will &amp;amp; Grace&lt;/em> regularly mentioned the store, reminding viewers of their expensive New York tastes. A version of the company’s stylish coffee house was cemented into the memory of &lt;em>Felicity&lt;/em> viewers, whose main character works as a barista at a Dean &amp;amp; DeLuca cafe. Perhaps most indicative of the special-occasion nature of a trip to Dean &amp;amp; DeLuca is a scene in &lt;em>The Devil Wears Prada&lt;/em> where boyfriend Nate (played by Adrian Grenier) brings home a celebratory bag of food from the luxury store for girlfriend Andrea (played by Anne Hathaway), remarking that “they charge, like, five dollars a strawberry there.”&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>NGL, it was at the Dean &amp;amp; DeLuca in SoHo where I had &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->my first taste&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> of panettone years ago. It was a fancy-schmancy panettone from Italy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t eaten many artisan panettoni, and I&amp;rsquo;ve tried making it myself a few times. Each and every panettone is a quest for achieving a crumb that&amp;rsquo;s simultaneously moist, light, decadent, and ethereal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why not make a panettone, during the sweltering summer? Turns out &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://www.dissapore.com/spesa/panettone-estivo-2022-sette-grandi-lievitati-per-lestate/">panettoni estivi&lt;/a>&lt;/em> already became a &amp;ldquo;trend&amp;rdquo; last year. Never short the hedonism of US consumers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I looked up panettone recipes by Carol Field, Roy Schvartzapel, Piergiorgio Giorilli, Iginio Massari, Ezio Marinato, Gino Fabbri, Giambattista Montanari, and Michel Suas to figure out the pattern across the maestros' methods. Then I decided to try something of my own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted this summer panettone to be lighter and fresher than a winter holiday version, so I used less butter, less sugar and no eggs. No, I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t want this one to be as brazenly buttery as Roy Schvartzapel&amp;rsquo;s luxury panettone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="impasto-1">Impasto #1&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>lievito madre&lt;/em> is too much work, so I used &lt;a href="https://theflavorbells.com/yeast-water/">homemade fruit yeast water&lt;/a> instead.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Slap &amp;amp; fold until a very soft, smooth and strong dough is formed (with ~80% gluten development).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ferment for 12 hours at ~72°F (longer at lower temperatures).&lt;/li>

&lt;p>To make &lt;em>pasta di arancia&lt;/em>, mix together peeled (and de-seeded) navel oranges, mandarins, tangelos, lemons, ginger, turmeric, honey, sugar, and orange zest in a blender until you get a creamy paste. The proportion of each ingredient depends on your personal preferences. You should make a big batch &amp;ndash; it can be kept in a sterilized glass jar in the fridge for a few weeks or in the freezer for a few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I soaked the dried fruits and flower petals in some dessert wine (Silver Dick - Wenwood Farm Winery, MO) overnight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also soaked some quinoa in double the amount of water overnight and let the seeds sprout. The wet sprouted quinoa came up to be 222% of final flour weight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Process (by hand):&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>To impasto #1, add all the flour, malt, salt and 1/3 of the water. Mix for a few minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the honey and mix in completely.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the &lt;em>pasta di arancia&lt;/em> and pawpaw purée. Slap &amp;amp; fold until just combined.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let rest for 15 mins.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the butter in 4 increments. Mix until the butter is completely incorporated into the dough and the gluten has reached full development.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let rest for 10 mins.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the rest of the water very slowly, mixing in completely before continuing. Adding water after butter is like lightening an emulsion; it made me think of making mayonnaise. &amp;mdash;-&amp;gt; TBH, no panettone recipe I&amp;rsquo;ve seen calls for this much water. I went with my gut and gorged the dough with as much water as I felt it could handle. Ludicrously, after a whopping 250% hydration, I felt the dough could handle even more h₂o&amp;hellip;(another experiment for next time?) It held together really well and didn&amp;rsquo;t break down at all. The dough started to feel as puffy and jiggly as a &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/aquaboogie">&lt;em>pan de cristal&lt;/em>&lt;/a>!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let rest for 10 mins.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stretch the dough out into a thin rectangle, and laminate with the add-ins (soaked fruits, petals and quinoa).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bulk-ferment at ~80°F for 1 hour, folding every 20 mins.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shape the dough and place into a baking mold. &amp;lt;&amp;mdash;- I thought about baking the dough flat out like I do with the &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/aquaboogie">&lt;em>pan de cristal&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. Not this time, because I was still hoping to make a &amp;ldquo;panettone,&amp;rdquo; which should be a tall loaf. I shaped the dough into a log and placed it into a loaf pan, so it would rise up to a proper height.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Proof for 4-6 hours at ~80°F (or ~12 hours at 72°F).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The dough should rise up 2x like a giant cotton candy before baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I baked it in my toaster oven at 350-325°F for 50 mins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After baking, I tipped the panettone over on its side and let it cool off like that for 24 hours, instead of doing the fancy upside-down hanging. NGL, the hanging method is definitely far more effective at helping the panettone&amp;rsquo;s delicate crumb maintain its elongated structure.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Despite the improper cooling, the panettone has turned out decent (not a devastating failure).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crumb feels superbly moist and delicate; it tastes boldly fruity and pleasantly sweet. We devoured half of the loaf in one sitting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you think about how much sugar, honey, and butter go into each panettone, how is it possible this thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a rich taste and a fluffy texture? They all help to elevate the crumb.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Honey (sugar) softens the crumb, while fats lubricate the dough and help the flour particles move alongside each other more smoothly, making the dough more flexible and stretchable. In breads with a high percentage of whole grains, a little honey brings out more of the grain&amp;rsquo;s flavor and balances out its earthiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Generic supermarket butter is ~80% fat; the remaining 20% is mostly water and some proteins. Fats do more than providing a smoother mouthfeel and a richer sensory experience. When an enriched dough is placed in a hot oven, the butter melts. As a result, the water content in the butter turns into steam. It&amp;rsquo;s that steam being trapped by the gluten in the dough that lifts the croissant off into honeycomb ecstasy. Meanwhile, the fat molecules become a bit more mobile and they will re-organize themselves slightly. Since fats don&amp;rsquo;t like to sit in water, they will actually surround the air bubbles in bread. This way the fat stabilizes the air bubbles. Consequently, enriched breads tend to have a lot of small air bubbles. Since the fats remain in place after baking (they cool down and solidify again), they will remain around these air bubbles. That acts like a protective layer and helps keep the bread fresh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both sugar and fat prevent the gluten from forming long, chewy strands and help produce a more tender bread, but they should be added only towards the end of mixing/kneading after the gluten network is mostly developed. Any type of sugar and fat will probably work just as well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This panettone is an absolutely fantastic substrate for the iconic Cuban &lt;em>medianoche&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; sweet, salty, and deeply satisfying. Yes, I use Italian panettone to make Cuban &lt;em>medianoche&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I got to sample a slice of Olivieri 1882&amp;rsquo;s latest &lt;em>panettone all&amp;rsquo;aceto balsamico&lt;/em> at a holiday party. It was lavishly soft, airy, and decadent; laced with balsamic cream and studded with balsamic-vinegar infused raisin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The packaging says it uses Carandini&amp;rsquo;s Balsamic Vinegar of Modena IGP. Olivieri&amp;rsquo;s website describes it as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Carandini, one of Modena&amp;rsquo;s oldest families, has been producing hand-crafted balsamic vinegars using traditional family methods since 1641. Their hero expression, the Emilio Balsamic Vinegar of Modena, is a premium, high-density vinegar that contains 60% grape must and strikes a delicate balance between sweet and sour. Exuding a mahogany color and rich perfume, the versatile product lends a subtle acidity and fragrant sweetness to Olivieri&amp;rsquo;s staple Panettone recipe.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>FYI, Carandini&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Aceto Balsamico di Modena IGP&lt;/em> (Balsamic Vinegar of Modena) is not a true &lt;em>Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale&lt;/em>, i.e. made from a reduction of pressed Trebbiano and Lambrusco grape that&amp;rsquo;s aged for a minimum of 12 years in a series of wooden barrels of successively smaller sizes. True balsamic vinegar is rich, glossy, deep brown in color, and has a complex flavor that balances the natural sweetness and sourness of cooked grape juice with hints of wood from the casks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Aceto Balsamico di Modena&lt;/em> is a commercial-grade cheaper imitation of the traditional balsamic vinegar. They can be made from as little as 20% grape must (and not necessarily from Modena or Reggio Emilia), with the addition of wine vinegar, coloring, caramel, and sometimes thickeners like guar gum or corn starch to artificially simulate the sweetness and thickness of the naturally aged &lt;em>Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena&lt;/em>. IGP status requires a minimum aging period of 2 months (not necessarily in wooden barrels), rising to 3 years when labeled as &lt;em>invecchiato&lt;/em> (aged).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;60% grape must&amp;rdquo; = 40% wine vinegar. Since Carandini&amp;rsquo;s Balsamic Vinegar of Modena has IGP in its label, it&amp;rsquo;s most likely produced in Modena. (For some reason, I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to come across a bottle of balsamic vinegar that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>not&lt;/em> made in Modena.)&lt;/p>

Infused with caramelized onions, spent brewer&amp;rsquo;s grains, and poppy seeds.</description><content>&lt;p>Charles Bukowski&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Ham on Rye&lt;/em> is one of my favorite books. I consider it one of his best works and surely one of the greatest novels in all literature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A ham on rye sandwich is about the simplest thing an American can eat. Ditto Bukowski&amp;rsquo;s writings are as simple as you get.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The leading rye-producing states in the US are the Dakotas, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Georgia. &amp;lt;50% of the rye grown in the US is harvested for grain, with the rest used as pasture/hay or as a cover crop. ~50% of the amount harvested for grain is fed to livestock or exported, and the remainder is used for distilling, food, and seed. In the Midwest, rye is primarily grown for grain, but occasionally for hay/pasture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For generations, ham on rye was the proletarian sandwich of choice in the Midwest (pastrami on rye in New York). Rye bread was part of the sacred Midwestern German-American trinity: sauerkraut, dill pickles and chewy rye with caraway seeds. Mothers in America made sandwiches for their kids to take to school, and a ham on rye was what kids would eat. It&amp;rsquo;s boring, but flavorful and filling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Hamming it up&amp;rdquo; means to overdo something, especially in acting. Bukowski&amp;rsquo;s book has little to do with the sandwich. I interpret the &amp;ldquo;ham&amp;rdquo; as a metaphor for the neon (pretense, not kosher), which he contrasted with the plain humble staple &amp;ldquo;rye,&amp;rdquo; to squeeze all of the pretense out of his life.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-rye-pyramid">The rye pyramid&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In my mind, there are generally 3 categories of rye breads, based on the percentage of rye they have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Brick ryes&lt;/strong> (&amp;gt;=66% rye): these breads are dense and brick-like; made completely or mostly from rye (rye flour, soaked rye, or cracked rye); leavened with rye levain; very sticky, must be mixed with a paddle; soft, despite the lack of wheat flour.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>walliserbrot&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>roggenbrot&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>gersterbrot&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>vollkornbrot&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>pumpernickel&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>borodinsky&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>rugbrød&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>rupjmaize&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>ruisleipä&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Intermediate ryes&lt;/strong> (30%-65% rye): these breads have a solid backbone of wheat, with varying degrees of rye, making them something akin to farmers' breads but with more rye and less wheat; they are distinctly chewy and flavorful.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>kornbroyt&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>pain de seigle&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>pain de méteil&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Rye-flavored breads&lt;/strong> (&amp;lt;30% rye): the bulk of the flour in these breads is wheat; the wheat provides structure, while the rye adds flavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>landbrot&lt;/em> (country bread)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>bauernbrot&lt;/em> (farmer&amp;rsquo;s bread)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In this category, there is a sub-group of enriched, flavored ryes (usually &amp;lt;15% rye) that became quite popular in America in the last century or so:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>American &lt;em>pumpernickel&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jewish deli rye&lt;/li>
&lt;li>marbled rye (the combination of American &lt;em>pumpernickel&lt;/em> and Jewish deli rye)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>onion rye&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There is another sub-group of lean ryes (&amp;lt;10%) such as the San Francisco Sourdough that add rye for some rustic nuance but I don&amp;rsquo;t consider them to be rye breads.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-american-bastardization-of-rye">The American bastardization of rye&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As a matter of fact, the so-called Jewish rye bread found in a contemporary Jewish bakery or delicatessen is &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/attack-of-the-ryeclops">an American invention&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; an American bastardization of a European rye. It&amp;rsquo;s a light, mild rye loaf made with a large amount of wheat flour and seasoned with caraway seeds, lacking the intensity of Minsk rye and Bavarian rye. It was popularized by Jewish delicatessens, but it&amp;rsquo;s not specific to the Jewish tradition, unlike &lt;em>challah&lt;/em> or &lt;em>matzah&lt;/em>. IMO, it&amp;rsquo;s as Jewish as General Tso&amp;rsquo;s chicken is Chinese.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rye is the main cereal crop in those areas of Eastern Europe most densely populated by Jews and was correspondingly cheap, especially compared with wheat. Rye has been a staple ingredient of vodkas for centuries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over there, the most common type of rye bread &amp;ndash; the one with the highest proportion of rye &amp;ndash; was called &lt;em>razeve broyt&lt;/em>, literally &amp;ldquo;black bread.&amp;rdquo; It was usually prepared at home, and consisted of as much rye flour as the bread could bear. The Yiddish writer and scholar Hirsh Abramovitch, who was born in 1881, described making such bread from single-grind rye flour, as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The whole kernel was used &amp;ndash; the bran, the starch, the germ, and everything else. Some flour and warm water were mixed together in a kneading trough and left to stand overnight, covered with a tablecloth which was covered in turn with a fur coat or a pillow. The warmth made the mixture start to ferment. Sometime before dawn, the sourdough was kneaded by hand for about three-quarters of an hour, while more flour and water were added. Once everything was thoroughly mixed, the trough was covered up again and left to stand somewhere warm for four or five hours until the mixture had risen, when it would be formed into loaves of between fifteen and twenty-five pounds. &amp;hellip; The loaves would sit in the oven for four to six hours, depending on their size. Women who didn&amp;rsquo;t want the tops of their loaves to be black would sift rye flour in a thick sieve, mix the sifted flour with water, and smear it on the tops of the loaves before putting them into the oven. &amp;hellip; They called this mixture &lt;em>kharmushke&lt;/em>; it gave the bread a &amp;ldquo;Jewish look,&amp;rdquo; in contrast to gentile bread, which was &amp;ldquo;as black as coal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Michael Wex, &lt;em>Rhapsody in Schmaltz&lt;/em> (2016)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This doesn&amp;rsquo;t even remotely resemble the wheaty light rye served in most Jewish delis today. Although people in the old days may have guts of iron rather than abs of steel, eating these dense rye bricks (allegedly 2 lbs. a day on average!) was hardly a lifestyle choice. &lt;em>Razeve broyt&lt;/em> was the food of poverty &amp;ndash; the most fundamental food that was available to everyone. The poorest people would stretch their rye flour by grating potatoes into it, and unwillingly eat the bread &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea6OET3Zi20">dry&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo; White bread was considered a luxury, and many Jews started switching to the lighter, more wheaty bread as soon as they could afford it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a matter of historical fact, wherever in Europe Jews settled, they adopted the local breads and slightly modified them to reflect the strictures of &lt;em>kashrut&lt;/em>. Therefore, the dark, sweet-sour ryes of Lithuania are every bit as Jewish as the light caraway-flecked ryes of southern Poland and Ukraine. The rye breads that managed to survive the journey to America, with the thousands of Jewish immigrants at the beginning of the 20th century, were those that best lent themselves to American conditions, namely, lower-percentage ryes that took advantage of the cheaper, easier-to-handle, and more abundant wheat that Eastern European Jewish bakers found when they arrived. The high-percentage ryes that represented the taste of home for Jews from Lithuania, Belarus and northern Poland had morphed into something new and uniquely American by the end of World War II. To mask the change, immigrant bakers loaded their breads with caraway seeds, which lent baked goods a fleeting flavor of anise/licorice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-regression-of-jewish-deli-rye">The regression of Jewish deli rye&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Jewish rye that caught on in the US &amp;ndash; the iconic bookends for pastrami &amp;ndash; probably began as some variation on the &lt;em>kornbroyt&lt;/em>. The OG unadulterated &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;em>kornbroyt&lt;/em>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> originated in central Europe, where &amp;ldquo;korn&amp;rdquo; is not maize/corn, but &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%90%D6%B8%D7%A8%D7%9F#Yiddish">Old High German&lt;/a> for &amp;ldquo;grain,&amp;rdquo; which in bread almost always refers to rye, and &amp;ldquo;broyt&amp;rdquo; is derived from Old High German &amp;ldquo;brōt,&amp;rdquo; meaning a loaf of bread. &lt;em>Kornbroyt&lt;/em> (literally &amp;ldquo;rye bread,&amp;rdquo; but nowadays often referred to as &amp;ldquo;Jewish corn rye&amp;rdquo;) is traditionally a heavy sourdough loaf built on a solid backbone of wheat, 30%-60% rye, and no maize/corn at all. It&amp;rsquo;s akin to farmer&amp;rsquo;s breads but with less wheat; it has a distinct chewiness and depth of flavor. As in &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/attack-of-the-ryeclops">Scandinavian &lt;em>smørrebrød&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, the peppery earthiness of rye pairs marvelously with rich and savory fillings like chopped livers, pastrami, and kosher salami.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously, &lt;em>kornbroyt&lt;/em> was one of the building blocks of the Jewish-American bread microcosm. In the early Jewish deli rye inspired by the &lt;em>kornbroyt&lt;/em>, 30%-40% of the total flour was either medium rye (~85% extraction) or white rye (65%-70% extraction, with the bran and germ removed), and the rest was wheat flour. The blend lets the rye shine through without taking over. The whiter the rye, the milder the flavor &amp;ndash; sometimes just a hint of rye.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By mid-20th century, an even lighter (~20% rye), mildly tangy, &amp;ldquo;shissel&amp;rdquo; (Yiddish for caraway, also spelt &amp;ldquo;sissel&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;cissel&amp;rdquo;) rye bread had swept across the US like wildfire. It&amp;rsquo;s fluffier, whiter, and less crusty than the old-fashioned 40% version, but closer to American-style white bread. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Jewish&amp;rdquo; because one could routinely find it on the shelves of the bakeries and delis that anchored Jewish settlements in major US cities and wherever else they established communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This &amp;ldquo;Jewish deli rye&amp;rdquo; became the American default, towering over other American rye breads such as sweet earthy &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;a href="https://www.allneedfulthings.net/NT_Breads/Old_Milwaukee_Rye.html">Old Milwaukee Rye&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, austere &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dakota rye&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Boston brown bread&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, all of which use at least &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/joeliath/">1/3 rye&lt;/a>. Its popularity probably contributed to people&amp;rsquo;s biggest misconception about rye bread: rye = caraway. Rye has &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/attack-of-the-ryeclops">so many faces, possibilities, and flavor elements&lt;/a> that to denigrate it to that one astringent note is to do it a tremendous injustice. People who think they don&amp;rsquo;t like rye probably just don&amp;rsquo;t like caraway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, in today&amp;rsquo;s delis, a 20% rye begrudgingly tossed with a tiny amount of &lt;em>shissel&lt;/em> is considered the standard of good deli rye &amp;ndash; and even such a loaf is hard to find these days. The Jewish deli rye at Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s, reputedly &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120305231242/http://www.saveur.com/article/Travels/best-rye-breads-in-america">America&amp;rsquo;s very best deli rye&lt;/a>, contains ~25% rye. By contrast, most commercial Jewish rye breads have &amp;lt;= 5% rye and rarely come with any &lt;em>shissel&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The shift came about during the post-WWII years, when white flour became cheaper, and easier to work with, than rye flour. The modern &amp;ldquo;rye&amp;rdquo; bread didn&amp;rsquo;t just lack in flavor and quality compared to traditional Jewish rye loaves: It was cheaper and lasted longer. In the 1960s-70s, industrial bakeries, such as Levy&amp;rsquo;s in Brooklyn, hooked many &lt;a href="https://forward.com/culture/482193/levys-jewish-rye-you-dont-have-to-be-jewish-model-joseph-attean-native/">conspicuously non-Jewish&lt;/a> New Yorkers on the taste of a packaged rye bread (pasteurized for a longer shelf life), with the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/business/judy-protas-writer-of-slogan-for-levys-real-jewish-rye-dies-at-91.html?_r=0">viral slogan&lt;/a> &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be Jewish to love Levy&amp;rsquo;s Real Jewish Rye.&amp;rdquo; That was a watershed moment. As independent Jewish bakeries failed to beat their larger, industrial competition, quality rye bread disappeared from delis.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Over the past 40-50 years, according to Stan Ginsberg and Norm Berg in their book &lt;em>Inside the Jewish Bakery&lt;/em>, the flavor and texture of commercial rye bread have been drastically watered down as baking companies went national &amp;ndash; and Americanized with it. Rye bread became paler and lighter in texture, with less and less rye flour and more and more additives (oils, conditioners, and preservatives). Commercial bakeries also started using commercial dry yeast instead of sourdough; the latter takes too long (as time has become the most precious commodity) and, for a long time, wasn&amp;rsquo;t generally considered reliable or controlled enough a process for mass production &amp;ndash; probably not good for FDA and local health inspectors, either. So most commercial rye bread lacks the true rye sour starter flavor, and is no longer naturally chewy or dark. Or crusty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Jewish delicatessens of New York are often sacrosanct institutions. Landmarks like Katz&amp;rsquo;s, Carnegie Deli, and 2nd Ave Deli serve up lovingly spiced pastrami and corned beef, but their bread is a disgrace. There, I said it! Rye at these &amp;ldquo;legendary&amp;rdquo; NYC delis is shoddy slices of dry, thin, bland, and oftentimes stale white bread that pass for Jewish rye by default, similar to the way DiGiorno can technically be called pizza.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Orwasher&amp;rsquo;s, one of NYC&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChZ4ZBQ1dkQ">most legendary&lt;/a> bakeries, still make 10-lb. loaves of &lt;em>shissel&lt;/em> rye daily, and customers can buy as much or as little as they need.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The original Orwasher&amp;rsquo;s opened in 1916 on East 78th Street between 1st and 2nd Avenues, by a Hungarian immigrant named Abraham Orwasher, when a stretch of Yorkville used to be known as &amp;ldquo;Little Hungary.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Under current owner Keith Cohen, who took over in 2007, the bakery has become more internationally-focused (i.e. more French baguettes and brioches, and American-style white bread) while maintaining its mom-and-pop feel. They have paid heed to the &amp;ldquo;local movement&amp;rdquo; (who hasn&amp;rsquo;t?) by incorporating regionally-grown grains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cohen has pushed hard to build out the distribution arm of the business, and the bakery now churns out ~10,000 loaves a day and sells to 100+ different places around NYC. Cohen &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfrOH5OwKBk&amp;amp;t=270s">says&lt;/a> Orwasher&amp;rsquo;s still makes its rye bread from an OG rye sour starter that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been remade in 100+ years, but the bakery&amp;rsquo;s rye bread is no longer what it was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cohen published &lt;em>Orwasher&amp;rsquo;s Artisan Bread&lt;/em> in 2014. Out of curiosity, I looked it up. Bingo, the book has a recipe for the bakery&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;New York rye bread.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The recipe doesn&amp;rsquo;t list any rye flour as an ingredient, but does call for a &amp;ldquo;rye biga.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book says the bakery keeps two rye bigas: one white at 46% hydration and one dark at 133% hydration. I would guess that the dark rye biga is built with dark rye flour, which is usually a wholegrain (100% extraction) flour complete with all the bran and germ; and the white rye biga is built with all-purpose rye flour (65%-70% extraction, with the bran and germ removed).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book specifies &amp;ldquo;white rye biga&amp;rdquo; as such wherever it&amp;rsquo;s called. Elsewhere, it lists simply &amp;ldquo;rye biga,&amp;rdquo; such as in this recipe. I&amp;rsquo;m assuming it either refers to the dark rye biga by default or they are meant to be interchangeable.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>453.6g of dark rye biga (133% hydration) = 194.6g dark rye flour + 259g water
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This means the total amount of (dark) rye present in the entire loaf is&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>194.6g / (194.6g + 1110g) = 14.9%
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>But in case it uses the white rye biga,&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>453.6g of white rye biga (46% hydration) = 310.6 white rye flour + 143g water
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The total amount of (white) rye present in the entire loaf would be&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>310.6g / (310.6g + 1110g) = 21.9%
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Even if this &amp;ldquo;rye biga&amp;rdquo; turns out to be a blend of the dark and the white, you know the range of rye percentages in Orwasher&amp;rsquo;s NY rye bread: &lt;code>14.9% dark rye&lt;/code> ~ &lt;code>21.9% white rye&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And caraway is a skimpy 4% of the total flour weight. That will probably get even skimpier given the caraway shortage caused by Covid-related supply disruptions.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I guess trying to run the business as a bakery, sandwich shop and café simultaneously that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner has diluted the quality of the oldie that made it famous. Still, kudos to Orwasher&amp;rsquo;s for being able to pay Manhattan rents every month and stay in business for 100+ years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On weekends, Orwasher&amp;rsquo;s also makes a postmodern &amp;ldquo;corn rye&amp;rdquo; with a local spin, using local Sixpoint Brewery&amp;rsquo;s Righteous Rye Ale in the dough.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A traditionally made &lt;em>kornbroyt&lt;/em> is highly prized by Jewish bread aficionados today because 1) as George Greenstein says in his 1993 book, &lt;em>Secrets of a Jewish Baker&lt;/em>, &amp;ldquo;there are few bakeries left that haven&amp;rsquo;t compromised its real flavor, moisture, and texture&amp;rdquo;; and 2) in this hyper-Instagrammable era of openest-crumb breadporn and hypnotizing unicorn bagels, the rougher-textured, leathery-looking loaf still has the pull and tang of tradition that transcends time.&lt;/p>

Sadly, most New Yorkers don&amp;rsquo;t know the difference between good and &lt;a href="https://larissazimberoff.com/articles/2014/07/why-is-new-york-rye-bread-so-bad.html">bad rye bread&lt;/a>. They just firmly believe in the superiority of their ryes, and foolishly brag about the magic of &lt;a href="https://www.ediblemanhattan.com/food-for-thought/why-is-new-york-tap-water-good/">NYC tap water&lt;/a>, which they love to credit for bestowing everything from pizzas to bagels to coffee with the city&amp;rsquo;s unique flavor. Apparently, that holy water has done nothing to save NYC&amp;rsquo;s rye bread from condemnation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The author Andrew Coe &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230123837/https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/rebuilding-the-jewish-bakery.html">explained&lt;/a> in a 2014 article:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You may have never heard of Shissel Rye before &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a bread that didn&amp;rsquo;t survive the softening and blandification of the New York rye tradition. &amp;ldquo;Shissel&amp;rdquo; means bowl in Yiddish, and maybe it&amp;rsquo;s so named because the loaf looks like an inverted bowl. From the outside, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to mistake it for a corn rye, because it has a similar leathery crust. But it&amp;rsquo;s made from wetter dough than corn rye, which gives the loaf a denser crumb and more pronounced sour twang.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Sure, there are dozens of new artisan bakeries that have tried to revive the real Deli rye bread and &lt;em>kornbroyt&lt;/em>. They are not rye bread as such, but &amp;ldquo;Old World&amp;rdquo; artisan wholegrain sourdough breads that seek to imitate &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUxClvWBHtk">Poilâne&amp;rsquo;s legendarily crusty boules&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="heartland--jewish-soul-food-mecca">Heartland = Jewish soul food mecca&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Few have looked west and figured out &lt;a href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/the-nosher/the-best-jewish-food-in-detroit/">the plethora of Jewish delis in Detroit&lt;/a> are some of America&amp;rsquo;s best-kept culinary secrets. That&amp;rsquo;s where the process of double-baking rye bread was pioneered and where legit Jewish rye breads are still made.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jews have lived in Detroit for &amp;gt;200 years. The earliest Jewish immigrants were mostly German, but plenty of Hungarian, Russian, and Polish Jews settled in the Detroit-Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area as well and brought their family recipes with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of the region&amp;rsquo;s early Jewish families opened grocery stores (Farmer Jack&amp;rsquo;s, Hiller&amp;rsquo;s, Freeman &amp;amp; Reese Grocers, etc.) and delis (Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s, the Stage Deli, etc). It was at the Stage Deli in Oak Park, in the post-WWII years when the composition of rye bread started incorporating larger and larger portions of cheaper and longer-lasting white flour, where the now-famed Detroit-style rye bread really began.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 1960s, Jack Goldberg, founder of the Stage Deli, was intent on serving the freshest rye bread to customers. Local bakeries delivered bread early in the morning, but most of Jack&amp;rsquo;s customers were coming in at lunch, when the rye bread they wanted was already cold. So he started ordering his rye bread partially cooked (baking halted ~80% of the way through). Just before the lunch rush, he would finish baking the bread in a steaming oven in house, so they were still warm in time for lunch. That last-minute steam gives the bread a soft, moist center and a crackly crispy crust. Additionally, forgoing the thin slicer that everyone else was using, Jack put the loaves on a deli meat slicer and cut the hot bread, fresh to order, into roughly 1&amp;quot; thick slices &amp;ndash; perfect for supporting the hulking pile of fatty meat without falling apart.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Most [sandwiches] are served on Jack Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s famous double-baked rye, a Detroit specialty. The rye in New York generally comes pre-sliced, in small disks about half an inch thick. The best deli ryes have a crisp, amber-colored crust and soft center, though these are increasingly difficult to find, especially in New York. Back when he started, Jack Goldberg pioneered the process of double-baking his rye breads. &amp;hellip; The warm loaf is cut into inch-thick slices on a diagonal. When you bite into a slice of double-baked rye, the difference in taste and texture is astounding. A thick, rustic crust greets your teeth, recalling the pleasurable chewiness of sourdough. The warm center of a double-baked rye has an airier density about it and doesn&amp;rsquo;t break apart when stressed with a Bye-Bye-Birdie (house-roasted turkey breast, chopped liver and Russian dressing). It makes New York&amp;rsquo;s rye taste like pigeon food.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Jack&amp;rsquo;s double-baked rye distinguished the Stage Deli from the competition. The method caught on, and soon enough every single Jewish deli across the Motor City was selling warm rye bread that held up well under pressure. Jack&amp;rsquo;s winning business formula is still used today at the Stage Deli in West Bloomfield.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Stage Deli, along with other local joints like Steve&amp;rsquo;s Deli and the Bread Basket Deli, all use thick-cut rye that employs a decent amount of rye flour blended with the white flour, unlike most of the rye-less loaves in New York masquerading as Jewish rye.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I first experienced double baked rye at the Bread Basket, a small chain of Detroit delicatessens, with Sy Ginsberg, the corned beef king of Michigan and much of the Midwest. As the waitress set down a sandwich of Ginsberg&amp;rsquo;s trademark corned beef in front of us, I was equally impressed with the bread. It had a darker flecked color to it, with a golden crust that reminded me of good sourdough. The crumb was warm to the touch, and the heat of the oven had released a tangy perfume of yeast. It felt like a little pillow in my hand, cradling the tender corned beef slicked with mustard. The crust had crackle and chew, the crumb was soft and doughy. It tasted like rye bread ought to.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Those who grew up in eastern Missouri / southern Illinois would vividly recall the taste of &amp;ldquo;tzitzel&amp;rdquo; rye from Pratzel&amp;rsquo;s Bakery, the last Jewish-owned kosher bakery in St. Louis. This round caraway rye bread came coated in cornmeal, and was the pride of the bakery&amp;rsquo;s founders, who opened shop in ~1913, and of their successors who operated the business until 2011.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A 2011 book, &lt;em>From the Jewish Heartland: Two Centuries of Midwest Foodways&lt;/em>, by Ellen F. Steinberg and Jack H. Prost, includes a long interview with the descendants of Max Pratzel, with particular fervor about the &lt;em>tzitzel&lt;/em> rye, which also appears in many other food memories about this bakery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.losttables.com/pratzels/pratzels.htm">Lost Tables&lt;/a>, an amazing website that chronicles lost restaurants in St. Louis, tells the story behind Pratzel&amp;rsquo;s rye:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Long before sourdough was a word associated with San Francisco, Jewish bakers were creating ryes and pumpernickel breads using sourdough starters they brought with them from Europe. When Max Pratzel came to St. Louis, he went to another Jewish baker and asked him for a small portion of his sour culture. Pratzel&amp;rsquo;s continued to grow that culture for almost 100 years and used it to make their rye bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bakers used cornmeal to glide loaves in and out of the baking ovens. Nate Pratzel liked the taste of the cornmeal coated rye bread bottoms so much that he would cut them off and take them home. Eventually, it occurred to him that it might be a good idea to cover the entire loaf with cornmeal, which is how one of Pratzel&amp;rsquo;s bestseller, tzizel rye bread, was born.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Luckily, the sister site Lost Dishes has posted a &lt;a href="https://www.lostdishes.com/pratzels/tzizel.htm">recipe&lt;/a> for the &lt;em>tzitzel&lt;/em> rye, for anyone who&amp;rsquo;s interested. It&amp;rsquo;s from a &lt;a href="http://littlecreekpress.com/bookstore/manna-cafe-and-bakery-cookbooka-memoir-of-two-businesses-a-community-and-the-food-that-connected-them/">recent cookbook&lt;/a> by descendants of the Pratzel family who moved to Wisconsin, opened a bakery there, and shipped the tzizel rye bread to hungry former St. Louisans around the country. The bakery &lt;a href="https://www.northsidenews.org/manna-cafe-bakery-closes-after-15-years-nourishing-the-northside/">closed&lt;/a> in the midst of Covid, as the Pratzels were at the end of their lease and approaching their own retirement age.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like everything else these days, Jewish deli rye &amp;ndash; like the bagel &amp;ndash; is becoming &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->an endangered species&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, with fewer and fewer bakeries making it the traditional way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="diy-old-school-deli-rye">DIY old-school deli rye&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you want a good deli rye, you gotta make it at home. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take years to bake yourself a decent loaf of rye bread that tastes delicious and can stand up to corned beef. Your great-(great-etc.) grandmothers most likely didn&amp;rsquo;t apprentice at a Paris &lt;em>boulangrie&lt;/em> and still churned out great rye bread with whatever starters they had and kept going throughout some pretty challenging winters. I also highly doubt they had the luxury of building a sour culture meticulously with all kinds of grains à la Tartine, discarding &amp;gt;=90% of it, replenishing it with a new supply of flour, and letting it mature for the right number of days until it was ready to set up in loaves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You just have to be willing to experiment and fail a couple of times and pay attention to how it looks, feels, smells, and be willing to fiddle around and adjust the next time. Early delivery, continual improvement, and flexible adjustment, much like agile software development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This rye I made is a variation of the old-school deli rye, closer to a &lt;em>kornbroyt&lt;/em> than a contemporary rye-flavored bread at delis.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

alt="kornerstone: Jewish deli rye"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I used a whole lot of single-grind wholegrain rye flour: 30% of final flour weight, and 45% of total flour weight (including the levain).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this dough contains a relatively high percentage of whole grains, I used a 2-dough lamination method to make it stronger. It has &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/breadford-von-regrainton/">worked well&lt;/a> for me before. I was able to give it a long fermentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also added some &amp;ldquo;altus,&amp;rdquo; which was originally a way for bakers to re-use bread they hadn&amp;rsquo;t sold. They would cut &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; rye bread into small pieces, soak in water until saturated and wrung out. It makes for a more tender and flavorful bread. I didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/zombie-dust/">soak my &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; rye bread&lt;/a> (you can use any type of bread); I just let it dry out a bit and ground it into crumbs in a coffee grinder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of caraway seeds, I used caramelized onions, spent brewer&amp;rsquo;s grains, and poppy seeds. If you are concerned about the opioids in poppy seeds, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2021.692045/full">studies&lt;/a> have shown that crushing and intensively cooking them significantly decrease their morphine content. Additionally, poppy seeds only truly develop their nutty flavor after crushing and baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rye flour I used is freshly milled &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/files/danko-rye.pdf">Danko&lt;/a> (&lt;em>Dańkowskie Nowe&lt;/em> in Polish), which is a high-yielding winter rye developed in 1976 by the Poznań Plant Breeding Center in Poland, for the purpose of milling. It was bred from a lineage of northern European ryes known for their high starch content and excellent baking performance in traditional whole rye loaves. Quite a few &lt;a href="https://danko.pl/en/odmiany-categories/rye/">newer Dańkowskie varieties&lt;/a> have been developed since. Danko itself hails from Poland&amp;rsquo;s Warta River Valley and adapts well to the Mid-Atlantic climate. It has a floral aroma when freshly milled, and a good flavor balance between bready and spicy. (I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to track down a &lt;a href="https://www.ryerevival.org/projects">Midwestern source&lt;/a> for Danko rye. If you know of any, &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/say-hi/">drop me a line&lt;/a>!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similar to how grape varietals and terroir influence the style and character of wines, so do varieties of rye &amp;ndash; and the soils and micro-climates they grow in. Rye whiskey derives its unique spicy and flavorful characteristics from the complexity of the grain. A traditional rye bread is definitively more flavorful than white bread. Many of the ryes that grow well in the US are old varieties brought over from Europe. There are also some newer hybrids that are being tested especially for local climate and soil conditions.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>As usual, I refreshed the levain 3 times with freshly milled wholegrain rye flour (80% hydration) over a period of 24 hours, and let it ferment at 60°F-70°F until it doubled in volume and was brimming with bubbles and a clean vinegary smell. Alternatively, you could sift the wholegrain rye into a medium rye flour and some coarse bits; use the former in the final dough, and feed the latter to the levain. You can manipulate the balance of acetic acid to lactic acid in the rye sour by changing the hydration: a dryer, more dough-like sour will contain more acetic acid and give a more vinegary flavor, while a wetter one (more like a thick paste at the start and a pancake batter once it&amp;rsquo;s developed) will tend more towards the lactic side and a yogurty/cheesy flavor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>America loves sweet onions! They are so popular that nowadays you can find them in any grocery store anytime of the year. I used a large Vidalia onion from a farmers' market. I cut the onion into medium-width slices, and cooked them on a George Foreman grill until brown and fragrant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dough #1: Autolyze the rye flour, whole wheat flour and breadcrumbs with just a little over half (~55%) of the total water. Mix thoroughly to hydrate every particle of the grain, cover, and leave for ~2 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dough #2: Mix together the 80% extraction wheat flour with the rest of the water. Cover and leave for ~2 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, add equal portion of the levain and the salt to each dough. Mix or slap &amp;amp; fold for 5-10 mins. The wholegrain rye-wheat dough is weak and sticky, but it&amp;rsquo;s OK. The 80% extraction wheat flour dough should be strong and extensible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fold each dough 3 times in the next 2 hours, at 30-min intervals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, the lamination: Wet your work surface with a spray bottle filled with water, to prevent the dough from sticking to it. Turn each dough out onto the damp surface, and gently spread it out as thinly and evenly as possible without tearing, into one large rectangle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carefully place the wholegrain rye-wheat dough on top of the other one. Try to line them up as much as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sprinkle all of the add-ins (onions, spent grains, and poppy seeds) all over the dough. Fold the dough into thirds (left-right, up-down) evenly and symmetrically to create the lamination and layer everything together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Transfer the dough into a fridge to finish bulk fermentation overnight. I did take it out a few hours later to do another couple of coil-folds, and returned it to the fridge immediately after. Total bulk-fermentation: 2.5 hours at room temperature (~70°F) and 12 hours in the fridge (~40°F).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next morning, take the dough out of the fridge. Mine doubled in volume overnight and felt so full of air pockets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pre-shape it loosely via a coil-fold. After a 30-min rest, shape the dough tightly into whatever form you desire. I shaped mine into a log, rolled it in additional onions and spent grains, and placed it in a parchment paper-lined loaf pan for final proof. You can, of course, roll the dough in a copious amount of caraway seeds or coarsely ground cornmeal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After 2 hours of final rise at room temperature, I baked it, as usual, in my ghetto toaster oven. The first 20 mins at 350°F, followed by another 30 mins at 300°F.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I waited 24 hours before cutting it. Patience is a virtue in short supply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crumb is highly moist and delicate. As soft as the finest goose down pillow.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It tastes much bolder than a typical deli rye.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like it toasted, smeared with cream cheese, and topped with olives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That tender crumb mingles marvelously with fatty, flaky corned beef, conjuring up a guilty pleasure so heavenly that it&amp;rsquo;s worth the heartburn.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A real Jewish treat, before everyone became uber health-conscious, used to be a roast beef sandwich on rye with Bermuda onions and &lt;em>schmaltz&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bread also pairs exquisitely with &lt;em>komijnekaas&lt;/em> (a classic Dutch gouda-style cheese seasoned with cumin and caraway seeds) or Veldhuizen&amp;rsquo;s caraway cheddar.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Just watched a Hallmark movie called &lt;em>Hanukkah on Rye&lt;/em>. All the sandwich breads featured in the movie looked so white that it made me think of this rye&amp;hellip; So I made another loaf &amp;ndash; with &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/attack-of-the-ryeclops">heritage Finnish rye&lt;/a>. I put some raw onions in the rye levain and added more caramelized onions to the final dough. Seriously onion-y.&lt;/p>

Took the Old Canada Road Scenic Byway from Maine to Québec City, and felt like I had teleported across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Québec sits just below the Arctic, which means it&amp;rsquo;s literally frozen half of the year. Holy shit, winter in Québec is cold &amp;ndash; temperatures could easily drop to -35°C (-31°F) with the windchill. I had to get a parka. But I love how Canadians like to one-up each other over how cold their town is, as if winter was an acquired taste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But Québec &amp;ndash; especially la Ville de Québec &amp;ndash; at Christmastime is a true winter wonderland, full of &lt;em>joie de vivre&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s like Québécois have perfected the art of winter aversion therapy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Québec is quite different from the rest of Canada (sort of like Scotland vs. England, or Puerto Rico vs. the US mainland). It&amp;rsquo;s a wonder that they have stayed together for this long. Québec gets a bunch of benefits (e.g. tax revenue, currency, and a governmental framework) from Canada that its own constantly-impoverished legislature could never provide, and Canada gets to enjoy a slice of Europe in between Ontario and New Brunswick. Friends with benefits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Au Québec, on parle français.&lt;/em> But my French is rusty. Québec&amp;rsquo;s language issues are too deep, and some places absolutely refuse to speak a word of English. I wanted to have a good time and experience Québec City like a local, so I brushed up on my &lt;em>français&lt;/em> before arriving.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Holy poutine, Montmorency Falls is actually taller than Niagara Falls and absolutely stunning &amp;ndash; even in the winter. The ice toboggan at Le Château Frontenac was incredibly thrilling and fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The two cornerstones of the Québécois cuisine are bread and meat (particularly pork), both of which I&amp;rsquo;m fond of. So I had the good fortune of sampling many local gourmet foods made by &lt;em>les artisans charcutiers&lt;/em> and &lt;em>les boulangers des grains nobles&lt;/em>. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never had &lt;em>saucissons&lt;/em> (&amp;ldquo;French salami&amp;rdquo;) from La Ferme des Quatre-Temps and Charcuterie Charlevoisienne, or cheeses from Fromagerie des Grondines and Laiterie Charlevoix, then you haven&amp;rsquo;t lived!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found an interesting indie magazine on Québécois food culture, &lt;a href="https://cariboumag.com/">Caribou&lt;/a>. Oh, there&amp;rsquo;s also a 5-volume tome about the history of family cooking in Québec, &lt;em>Histoire de la cuisine familiale du Québec&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that Québec produces an overwhelming majority of the world&amp;rsquo;s maple syrup (&lt;em>sirop d&amp;rsquo;érable&lt;/em>), it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising Québécois drizzle maple syrup on everything, even the eggs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, I brought back some La Meunerie Milanaise wheat berries. No clue what specific cultivar these wheat berries are, other than some kind of hard red wheat grown in Québec. The nutrition label says it has 11.11% protein.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the Spring 2018 issue of Bread Lines, published by the Bread Baker&amp;rsquo;s Guild of America, La Milanaise whole wheat flour is a blend of hard red winter/spring wheats. The nutrition label says it has 11.67% protein. I doubt La Milanaise uses vastly different blends in its wheat berries and WW flours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The way the grain industry works in Canada reminds me a lot of America&amp;rsquo;s three-tier system of alcohol distribution: producers sell only to processors, who then &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->sell only through their distributors&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and distributors sell only to businesses. You rarely know which specific farm the grains come from, let alone meeting the farmers. You can&amp;rsquo;t buy La Milanaise products directly from La Milanaise anymore. You gotta find them at local retailers or place special orders through Avril Supermarché Santé.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I confess I hesitated about buying these wheat berries because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what cultivars they were or who grew them, which is against &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/about">my philosophy&lt;/a>, but I decided to fuck it because YOLO&amp;hellip;and it&amp;rsquo;s Canada where the face of flour is Robin Hood, owned by US multinational Cargill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also got some La Milanaise oat groats. Québec doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly grow a lot of oats. There are &amp;gt;=30 organic oat producers in eastern Québec, mostly in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and Bas-Saint-Laurent, but altogether they produce just ~5% of Canada&amp;rsquo;s oats. The Prairies (especially Saskatchewan) produces 93%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously, Canada is great at growing oats, but not so great at processing them. Most of them are exported as raw commodities. &lt;a href="https://oatcanada.com/">Oat Canada&lt;/a> gets its crops from Alberta, but only &lt;em>after&lt;/em> the oats have been shipped to a facility in the US or Europe and processed into a concentrated protein powder. That&amp;rsquo;s the Canadian way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something else I learned about Québécois grains: a few decades ago, nobody believed that quality bread wheat could be grown in Québec. The hot, dry summers of Western Canada produced hard spring wheat, which yielded the ideal flour for bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HHT86JsCpRI" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Just before the turn of the millennium, the move towards artisan bread was starting to take hold in Québec. Bakers from France arrived in droves, and had an excruciatingly hard time producing French breads locally with the strong flours (~14% protein) milled from hard spring wheat. A growing demand thus emerged for a type of wheat that didn&amp;rsquo;t interest the Western Canadian farmers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>La Milanaise, which started out as a mixed farming business in &lt;a href="https://lamilanaise.com/en/history/">the 1970s&lt;/a> in the village of Milan in the Estrie region, rose up to the challenge of filling that void. With strong government support, La Milanaise pioneered the organic grain industry in Québec and nurtured the province&amp;rsquo;s wheat culture. Québec now dominates organic farming growth in Canada, and produces winter wheat with far more complex aromas than spring wheat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>La Milanaise has become a leading &lt;em>processor&lt;/em> of organic grains in Canada, exporting grain products to the US, Europe and Latin America. It sources &amp;gt;=60% of its grain from Québec farmers, and only purchases out West what cannot be grown locally. (Obviously, agriculture is heavily subsidized and protected by &lt;em>le gouvernement du Québec&lt;/em>.) It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell which La Milanaise grains are grown in Québec and which are from elsewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, La Milanaise has joined hands with Québécois bakery chain Première Moisson to found another mill, &lt;a href="https://moulinsdesoulanges.com/language/en/home/">Les Moulins de Soulanges&lt;/a>, to develop specialty flours tailor-made to the needs of Québécois artisan bakers. Flours from La Milanaise are featured in Daniel Leader&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Local Breads&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not as keen on pre-milled flours as whole grains. But I did stop by Première Moisson (majority-owned by supermarket chain Metro since 2014) on Boulevard Lebourgneuf and got a WW buckwheat bread with Charlevoix hemp seeds. It was delicious and I felt fuckin' Canadian.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>White Sonora is a soft &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/joeliath/">white&lt;/a> winter wheat (SWWW) that has been adapted to the southwestern US, specifically the semi-arid climates of the Sonoran Desert in California and Arizona. It&amp;rsquo;s a very old wheat, first brought to the American Southwest by Spanish missionaries in the 17th century. They made a stretchy dough that gradually evolved into the flour tortilla.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With low gluten-forming potential, Sonora is considered an ideal flour for pastries rather than breads. Well&amp;hellip; Since I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of cakes and desserts, what should I do with my Sonora?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out you can make a tall and fluffy bread just fine, with 100% Sonora flour. I learned a lot from my &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/orange-sunshine/">previous experiment with Warthog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/desert-dynamo/202111291613.jpg"
alt="Desert Dynamo"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The bread has a lovely flavor and texture, which are further enhanced by adding ~1% &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->diastatic barley malt&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and a squeeze of &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->orange juice&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the dough. Diastatic malt increases the conversion of starches to sugar, boosting the Maillard reaction of the crust. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in orange juice &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->tightens the gluten network&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and gives the bread &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215091859/http://www.clausmeyer.dk/en/grupe___meyer_flour/bread_recipes.html">a better rise&lt;/a>. As a result, the crumb is more chewy, and the crust more caramelized.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may be wondering, why not work with a strong wheat, to begin with? Why would anyone want to learn how to work with weak wheat varieties?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, you get to enjoy the distinctive flavors of these weaker wheats: nutty, herbal, earthy, sweet, spicy, etc. Why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t a baker/foodie want to try all this variety?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you buy packaged bread flour, whole wheat flour, or generic hard wheat berries, you are usually buying a blend of strong wheats grown in god-knows-where and mixed to achieve consistent characteristics such as a protein content of 12%-15% and the ability to form a strong gluten network. In contrast, when you buy a specific variety of grain, you are getting an individual product with unique characteristics (which vary somewhat from harvest to harvest).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s important to preserve &lt;a href="https://thecounter.org/united-nations-fao-report-biodiversity-loss-simran-sethi/">crop biodiversity&lt;/a> and move away from large-scale industrial monocultures &amp;ndash; planting only a few strains of a single crop means that a new pest or virus could virtually wipe out an entire plant species. It&amp;rsquo;s time we give power back to the farmers who understand the land and know how to manage different varieties and species of plants. Biodiversity is critical to a robust food system, a prerequisite for food and nutrition security. Do I even need to mention the obvious benefit of delicious flavors?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There are may of us who cannot but feel dismal about the future of various cultures. Often it is hard not to agree that we are becoming culinary nitwits, dependent upon fast foods and mass kitchens and megavitamins for our basically rotten nourishment.&amp;rdquo; - M.F.K. Fisher&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Thirdly, protein percentage is not indicative of the wheat&amp;rsquo;s baking performance &amp;ndash; the correlation between protein levels and gluten strength isn&amp;rsquo;t strong. It&amp;rsquo;s entirely possible to have high protein levels with weak gluten (e.g. durum, einkorn). Similarly, bread wheats grown in the more humid areas often have weaker gluten as well. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad thing &amp;ndash; some people relish the softer crumb from weaker gluten.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s totally possible to make good bread with weak wheat, but it takes some adjustment. IMO, any baker who relies on high-gluten flour or added vital wheat gluten to produce good bread is a cheat. Being able to produce great breads from any type of wheat takes knowledge and skills.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>So, how do you bake a bread with weak flour? The &lt;em>bassinage&lt;/em> technique is a tip. Adding natural enhancers like diastatic malt and &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/files/bread-improver-malt-vitamin-c.pdf">ascorbid acid&lt;/a>, as mentioned earlier, is another. Here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href="https://thebakingnetwork.com/protecting-gluten-in-a-weak-dough/">door&lt;/a> to the rabbit hole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I ran the Sonora wheat berries through the mill several times to get the finest grind possible. Smaller particles help the gluten bond better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also bolted the flour to take out 10% of the coarsest bits, which I scalded and then fed to the levain. It was all added back in the final dough; the wholegrain integrity of the bread is never compromised.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Mix the flour with salt, malt and flaxseeds. Autolyze with cold orange juice and ~2/3 of the water for 20-30 minutes in the fridge. The gluten will develop more readily in a drier dough environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add the levain and the remaining water (&lt;em>eau de bassinage&lt;/em>) gradually, and mix until thoroughly incorporated. Minimal handling is preferred.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Transfer the dough to a fridge right away and ferment for 24 hours. Do a coil-fold every 3-4 hours. Sprinkle the add-ins during the last couple of folds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After 24 hours of bulk fermentation, I shaped the dough into a log, put it in a sandwich loaf pan, and let it rise at room temperature for ~3 hours before baking.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Simply put, diastatic malt is a grain which has been sprouted, dried and grounded into a powder.

In a reaction catalysed by another flour enzyme, DHAA converts glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide naturally found in wheat flour, to its dimer (GSSG). GSH, but not GSSG, can form disulfide bonds – so removing GSH prevents it from disrupting the disulfide crosslinking that otherwise form between gluten proteins.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

It was a blast. Came back with a boatload of pawpaws, acorns, hickory nuts, and black walnuts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Acorns are not delicious right off the tree, which is likely what started the modern misconception that they are inedible. Acorns are definitely edible. They just require a process called &amp;ldquo;leaching&amp;rdquo; to remove the bitter tannins and become palatable, and all it takes is water and time. The internet has a ton of information on how to do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4zyI6vn9Azg" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Black walnuts are a pain in the butt to process. So I took the whole load to a local hulling station, and paid a small fee (60¢/lb) to have the black walnuts dehulled and cleaned. Just got a big sack of clean and dry whole black walnuts back. All I needed to do was crack the black walnuts and hickory nuts on my vintage metal nut cracker, and pick out the nut meat. A tedious yet meditative activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the acorns were done leaching and the nuts shelled, I wanted to make a bread to celebrate the beautiful season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I came up with a Midwest Blend of heritage wheat flours:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>50% Red Fife (Anarchy Acres, WI): a HRSW first grown in Canada in 1842 by farmer David Fife; aka. the OG Canadian Wheat&lt;/li>
&lt;li>30% Turkey Red (Ben Penner Farms, MN): a beautiful HRWW, as &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/the-wheatwalker/">previously demonstrated&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>20% Goldcoin (Anarchy Acres, WI): a SWWW with &amp;lt;10% protein&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After reading up on acorns, I decided to infuse them into the dough in 3 different ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>roasted acorn flour: dehydrate leached acorn meal, grind into a fine flour, and roast slowly in an oven until dark brown and caramelized (but not burnt)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>acorn levain: build a levain with leached wet acorn meal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cream of acorn: cook leached acorn meal into a porridge, with flaxseeds, poppyseeds, chia seeds, and sunflower seeds&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, yeah, a boatload of acorns in this bread. Because, why not?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Formula for the dough:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A very light and airy crumb. Reminded me of my &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/the-wheatwalker">first Turkey Red bread&lt;/a>, but this one is much more chewy and &amp;ldquo;spongy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="70-turkey-red--30-triticale">70% Turkey Red + 30% triticale&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Triticale (&lt;em>Tricosecate&lt;/em>) is a man-made cross of wheat (&lt;em>Triticum&lt;/em>) and rye (&lt;em>Secale&lt;/em>), exhibiting characteristics of both grains, i.e. triticale contains the complex flavor and nuance of rye, mellowed by the easier behavior of wheat. It has been around for well over a century. It was &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/files/Stace-Triticale-1987.pdf">first bred in labs&lt;/a> in the late 1800s in Scotland and Germany, in order to combine the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance of rye.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;em>Star Trek&lt;/em> episode &amp;ldquo;The Trouble with Tribbles&amp;rdquo;, the protection of a grain developed from triticale is the central focus. This grain was a genetically-engineered hybrid of wheat and rye with four distinct lobes per kernel, hence the name &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Quadrotriticale">quadro-triticale&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo; Mr. Spock attributes the ancestry of the root grain, triticale, to 20th-century Canada.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indeed, in 1953 the University of Manitoba in western Canada began the first intensive triticale breeding program in North America, working mostly with durum wheat-rye crosses. Early efforts concentrated on developing a high-yield, drought-tolerant human food crop species suitable for marginal wheat-producing areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was only after the 1970s that farmers started to grow this grain on a commercial scale &amp;ndash; mostly for forage or fodder. Over the years, triticale&amp;rsquo;s popularity has surged and ebbed. Farmers tend to either love the crop and continually plant it, or give it a go once and decide they like other grains better. Triticale has recently &lt;a href="https://hayandforage.com/article-2178-a-call-to-triticale.html">resurfaced&lt;/a> as a choice grain for high-protein feed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the vast potpourri of hybrid grains that have been developed so far, at least this one has been around for well over a century and has had more research than some other stuff that has been engineered in the last ~5 years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Triticale is mostly grown in Europe (Poland, Germany, Belarus, France and Russia), but you can find it easily in North America and Australia these days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an attempt to better understand the idiosyncrasies of this grain, I ferreted out as much information as possible on the internet. What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Triticale actually has a higher protein content than wheat and, at the same time, a lower gluten content than wheat due to genetic inheritance from rye. The latter trait has deprived the grain of superstardom in the breadmaking fraternity. A suggested solution: blend &amp;lt;=30% triticale flour into a wheat dough.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unlike rye, triticale actually has a very poor ability to absorb water. Start with low hydration (~60%) if making a 100% triticale bread, and don&amp;rsquo;t expect a tall, fluffy loaf.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Triticale appears to benefit from the LAB fermentation process of a natural leaven. This helps to make the protein more soluble and improves the viscosity of the dough itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A triticale dough also benefits from minimal handling, i.e. &amp;ldquo;no knead&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;folding&amp;rdquo;, because it has a low mixing tolerance.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Triticale seems to be a good candidate for blending, rather than using it totally on its own.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Pan de cristal&lt;/em> (called &lt;em>pa de vidre&lt;/em> in Catalan) is a Spanish &amp;ldquo;glass bread&amp;rdquo; invented in ~2004 by Barcelonian baker Jordi Nomen. It&amp;rsquo;s characterized by high hydration and double fermentation, which causes a very hollow and alveolate crumb that&amp;rsquo;s almost non-existent. &lt;em>Pan de cristal&lt;/em> is now a registered trademark &lt;a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/913153046">owned by its creator&lt;/a>. Nomen&amp;rsquo;s next bakery, Concept Pa, has developed a more extreme variety called &lt;em>&lt;a href="http://www.pandecristal.com/products/diamond-crystal-bread-r/">pan de cristal® diamante&lt;/a>&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Claudio Perrando, a German-Panamanian baker who rose to international stardom over the last decade through the internet, seems to be the most famous ambassador of &lt;em>pan de cristal.&lt;/em> His version has translucent crumb and such MASSIVE holes that it undoubtedly wins the competition for the Bread with the Fewest Calories per Cubic Centimeter. He sells his recipes online. I&amp;rsquo;ve never bought his recipes, but from what I can tell, he uses an over-ripe poolish and a long autolyse (with high-gluten super-fine flour) to add more extensibility to the dough. He does a 3-4h warm bulk-fermentation and a 1h final proof.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Add the next 30% &lt;em>aqua&lt;/em> in 4 increments &lt;em>à la bassinage&lt;/em>. Make sure each addition of water is well absorbed before adding more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let rest for 15-20 mins, and mix in the salt with the last 5% &lt;em>aqua&lt;/em>. The dough will noticeably tighten after absorbing the salt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let rest for 30 mins before mixing in the oil. The dough should be super airy and jiggly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perform 5 coil folds, at 45-min intervals. Sprinkle any add-ins at each fold, e.g., cinnamon sugar, chocolate chips, herbs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bulk ferment at 75F for 3h and retard in the fridge overnight. (Or straight to the fridge for 36-48h after the first 2 folds at room temperature.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>BTW, I make &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/aquaboogie-van-wheatsworth/">wholegrain versions&lt;/a>, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>This is also the base recipe I use for my scandalous &lt;em>schiacciata toscana&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s supposedly a Florentine flat bread that is characteristically closer to a &lt;em>pizza bianca&lt;/em> than anything else, made famous by All&amp;rsquo;antico Vinaio (rumored to be the greatest sandwich shop in the world).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Florentine &lt;em>schiacciata all&amp;rsquo;olio&lt;/em> uses a goodly amount of olive oil and large grain salt, and the best is cooked in a wood burning oven. It should be crispy but not hard, oily but not greasy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If making &lt;em>schiacciata&lt;/em>, flip the dough onto a rectangular baking sheet. Use fingers to gently dent and push the dough outwards towards all four corners, preserving the air bubbles inside, until the dough is about 3/4&amp;quot; (2 cm) at its thickest part. Make random dimples 2&amp;quot; (5 cm) apart that puncture all the way through the dough to the pan. This will prevent the dough from doming too much while baking and help create even thickness for sandwiches. Drizzle olive oil all over the surface of the dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best way to appreciate the unique flavor of Turkey Red &lt;em>pan de cristal&lt;/em> is to add a touch of salted butter and/or honey and eat while still slightly warm. When the bread starts to stale, toast it and dunk it into a warm, funky dip like a &lt;em>bagna càuda&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I toasted some oat groats (from Lonesome Whistle Farm, OR) and then milled them. These oat flour brownies (with sourdough discard) came out freakin' fabulous. Soft, fudgy, but not dense. Home-milled oat flour gives the brownies some nuttiness, even without nuts involved. (Not sure how Canadian oats compare to American oats.) Oat flour has no gluten, rendering the brownies practically impervious to overbaking. The sourdough doesn&amp;rsquo;t really give the brownie any lift &amp;ndash; it just lends a whisper of tangy flavor that offsets the sweetness and complements the chocolate.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There isn&amp;rsquo;t much a pan of warm brownies and a glass of milk will fix. In less it&amp;rsquo;s low grain prices. Or poverty. Or the national debt.&amp;rdquo; - Lois Greiman&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Then a shipment of Edison arrived, before the brownies were gone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Edison is a HWSW developed by the WSU Bread Lab, named after the nearby town of Edison, Washington, which had once been a wheat shipping port for Skagit Valley. Edison is now known as a reliable cultivar in western and central Oregon, western Washington and the Blue Mountain area. Protein content is 10%-13%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A crazy idea popped into my head: marbled brownie bread! Heresy, I know!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I made it.&lt;/p>

A kaleidoscope of fun flavors.</description><content>&lt;p>I love &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> (抹茶), which is basically powdered green tea. Like anything in life, it&amp;rsquo;s an acquired taste. I hated bitter beers when I first tried them, but now I love the likes of Chimay Cinq Cents and Stone Ruination. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never had &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> before, you will likely not love it the first time you try it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how is &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> different from other green teas, you ask? Well, first of all, it differs in the preparation process. Most teas are infused with water and the leaves are strained out and discarded, whereas &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> is actually whisked into hot water, i.e. the tea leaves are consumed directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> actually goes through extra processes during cultivation compared to the general category of green tea usually referred to as &lt;em>sencha&lt;/em> (煎茶, steamed, rolled, and dried green tea leaves). Once the buds of the &lt;em>Camellia sinensis&lt;/em> tea leaves start to sprout, the entire crop is kept in the shade for about a month before harvesting. This slows down the rate of photosynthesis, increasing the amount of chlorophyll in the leaves. In the end, this produces a tea leaf with a sweet flavor and bold &lt;em>umami&lt;/em>. Lastly, the steamed and then thoroughly dried tea leaves are meticulously ground on a stone mill into a fine powder. This powder form is what makes it possible to add a concentrated green tea flavor to many products.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Chinese were the first to grow and grind green tea. However, the Japanese were the ones who invented the method of creating &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> as we know it today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Japanese tea cultivation started when a 12th-century monk named Myouan Eisai (明菴栄西) brought green tea seeds &amp;ndash; along with the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism &amp;ndash; from China and planted them on Mt. Sefuri. In addition, he gave tea seeds to Myoue Shounin (明恵上人), a monk from Kousan-ji temple (高山寺) in Toganoo (栂尾), Kyoto. Shounin planted the seeds near the temple and &amp;ndash; voilà! &amp;ndash; this was the start of Uji tea. Oh, Eisai also wrote a book about tea, called Kissa Yojoki (喫茶養生記), often translated as &amp;ldquo;How to Stay Healthy by Drinking Tea.&amp;rdquo; The book begins with &amp;ldquo;Tea is the ultimate mental and medical remedy and has the ability to make one’s life more full and complete”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a long time, only the nobility and upper echelons of the Japanese society drank green tea. It was not until the Meiji Restoration at the end of the 19th century that the cultivation, consumption and preparation of green tea became widespread in Japan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Modern Japan has developed the most advanced and refined industry for the cultivation of a few varieties of green tea. Furthermore, it&amp;rsquo;s the world&amp;rsquo;s second largest green tea producer after China. As green tea became more popular in the West over the last two decades, China has begun to produce more and more of its own &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>matcha&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; under &amp;ldquo;simulated&amp;rdquo; Japanese farming conditions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like wine grapes, the quality and growth of green tea are greatly affected by the region&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>terroir&lt;/em>. Being Japan&amp;rsquo;s oldest and most famous green tea region means Uji is inevitably a hot spot for tea tourism. People love to visit Kyoto tea country&amp;rsquo;s traditional tea shops and modern tea emporiums, stroll through rolling hills of tea fields, and sample a variety of teas. I know people who have travelled to Uji, Japan to taste &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> and still feel only so-so about it. Lol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a Japanese proverb that says &amp;ldquo;good medication is bitter in taste&amp;rdquo; (良薬は口に苦し), and &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> is one of them. Matcha has a unique, complex taste. It&amp;rsquo;s slightly bitter, with a sweet aftertaste; it&amp;rsquo;s buttery and nutty, with a seaweedy undertone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David&amp;rsquo;s Tea &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> is a good place to start, although it&amp;rsquo;s likely not the best &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> that you&amp;rsquo;ll ever have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One way to enjoy the mild bitterness of &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> more is to add it to baked goods. Baking enhances the rich aroma of the &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em>, and that&amp;rsquo;s why there are gazillion forms of &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em>-flavored baked goods in Asia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this bread, I selected flours from below the Mason Dixon line. The American South is synonymous with sweet tea, and South Carolina remains the only US state that commercially produces tea on a large scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Generally, soft wheats have a high starch yield on milling and a low protein content. They are grown in areas of high rainfall and lower soil fertility, primarily east of the Mississippi River. Low-protein southern flours are deployed to their best advantage in their growing region&amp;rsquo;s specialties-biscuits, pies, and cakes where tenderness is prized over strength. Beyond wheat&amp;rsquo;s given genetic quotient of hardness or softness, environmental conditions determine the hardness of any given crop. Not only the overall protein content but also the quality and specific amounts of each protein present can be affected by seasonal variations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Wheats grown in the South generally aren&amp;rsquo;t very strong. This bread is another reminder to pay attention to the quality and property of ingredients grown in a particular region.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> I used here is Marukyu-Koyamaen &lt;em>aoarashi matcha&lt;/em> (丸久小山園の抹茶青嵐). It&amp;rsquo;s an entry-grade &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> with intense flavors &amp;ndash; better for baking than sipping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3% &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> may seem too little, but &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> is only consumed about 1-2g at a time. &lt;em>Usucha&lt;/em> (薄茶), the common &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> preparation, usually calls for 1 tsp/2g of &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> per 70-80ml of water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everyday/ceremonial (not cooking) &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> is usually made from high-grade &lt;em>gyokuro&lt;/em> (玉露), not &lt;em>sencha&lt;/em>. But for cooking &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em>, you don&amp;rsquo;t need such high grade. You could technically make your own at home, by pulverizing some high-quality green tea leaves in a coffee grinder and sifting a few times to get a fine powder. It&amp;rsquo;s totally fine in lattes, smoothies and baked goods. Some heresy right here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, wtf is &lt;em>genmaicha&lt;/em> and why did I use it instead of plain h₂o? Well, &lt;em>genmaicha&lt;/em> (玄米茶) is basically a Japanese popcorn tea: a blend of roasted puffed brown rice and &lt;em>sencha&lt;/em>. You taste green tea and popcorn at the same time &amp;ndash; the best of both worlds!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted a robust green tea flavor in this bread. That&amp;rsquo;s why I brewed a pot of Ippodo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>genmaicha&lt;/em> and soaked the flour in the cooled tea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rouge de Bordeaux was the OG baguette wheat from the Bordeaux region of France. It gained popularity in the 19th century among artisan bakers who loved the smooth, mellow flavor, aroma of spices, and robust performance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Spelt is an ancient wheat with a golden color and notes of honey and fresh hay. It&amp;rsquo;s quite versatile &amp;ndash; strong enough for bread and pasta, but delicate enough for pastry doughs, cakes and cookies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just mix everything together, and leave them in two separate containers in the fridge overnight. Yes, overnight autolyse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously, the green dough is going to be the stronger sibling and do most of the heavy-lifting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next day, I let them warm up to room temperature before adding 40% ripe levain and 2% salt. The green dough was very extensible and easy to work with. The cocoa dough, not so much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I laminated both &lt;em>pâtes&lt;/em> together and added 10% toasted walnuts and 20% dried fruits (raisins, dates, and jujubes).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dough went through 4 hours of bulk fermentation at room temperature with 3 folds, and had ~50% rise in volume before preshaping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2 hours of warm proof in a loaf pan before baking. Fantastic oven spring.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Cooled overnight and sliced next morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bread turned out less airy than I expected. The &lt;em>matcha&lt;/em> turned out more hydroscopic than I thought it would be, and the green &lt;em>pâte&lt;/em> was a little too taut. Next time I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely increase the hydration. The green tea flavor was noticeable but mellow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crumb was tender, moist, and mildly chewy. A taster said the sweet fruity aroma immediately reminded him of spiced apple cider!&lt;/p>

It metamorphosed into a whole wheat alveolate ecstasy that you never knew existed.</description><content>&lt;p>A few weeks ago, I got some organic Karl92 wheat from Richard, grown by a local farmer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Karl92 is a modern high-quality HRWW variety, selected from &amp;ldquo;Karl&amp;rdquo; by R. G. Sears, leader of the Manhattan wheat program from 1982 to 2000. Karl92 has higher yield and better disease resistance than the OG variety. Protein content is ~12%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This lot of Karl92 got invaded by wild onions while still growing in the fields, and the wheat berries picked up an oniony aroma. I thought naturally onion-scented wheat was quite interesting &amp;ndash; I wondered if it would be a great flour for a herbaceous bread. There&amp;rsquo;s a niche market for everything. If I were to market this batch of Karl92, I would label them &amp;ldquo;Funkadelic Ecstasy organic whole wheat: kissed by wild onions, ingrained with Mother Earth&amp;rsquo;s inherent magic.&amp;rdquo; Coastal foodies and food snobs would go crazy about it. No doubt. FWIW, there&amp;rsquo;s a toy company that sells squishy onions &amp;ndash; stress balls in the shape and color of a red onion and, when you squish them, they actually release onion scents to encourage further stress relief.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also got a batch of Karl92 whole wheat flour that was milled a while ago and starting to smell musty. I know, 99% of people would just toss it in the trash. But the zero-waster in me was curious whether this batch of flour could be &lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-4337.12481">salvaged through fermentation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I dumped the flour (1,722g) on a BBQ grill, and let it smoke over a bunch of corn husks for a few hours. The smelly flour picked up a nutty, endearing, almost bacon-y aroma. Then I sifted the smoked flour twice: got 237g coarse bran (14%) out the first time, and 220g middlings (13%) the second time, leaving 1,265g flour (73% extraction).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I divided the 237g coarse bran into&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>200g: for levain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>37g: for dusting/coating&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And thus began my cosmic adventure into the funky world of Karl92.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="levain-425g">Levain: 425g&lt;/h4>

&lt;tr>
&lt;td>sourdough starter, stiff WW&lt;/td>
&lt;td>20g&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Pour boiling water over the coarse bran in a gass bowl. Mix well. Let it sit for a few hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can add the malt while the bran soaker has cooled off some, but add the starter only after the bran soaker has cooled off completely to room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on my previous baking experiments and consumption of scientific studies, the most effective way to process the bran and improve its texture is sourdough starter + alpha amylase + xylanase, let sit for 24 hours at 24°C/75°F. (I&amp;rsquo;ve done this many times on oat hull fiber and have achieved good results. I have a friend who&amp;rsquo;s pathologically obsessed with &amp;ldquo;volume eating&amp;rdquo;, e.g., consuming large volumes of food while taking in minimal calories at the same time. Oat fiber is insanely popular among these volume-eaters, because the boatload of fiber in it increases the volume of food while adding zero net carbs or calories.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Depending on the genotype, dry wheat bran can contain about 50% dietary fiber and 9%-25% starch. Most of that dietary fiber in bran is insoluble fiber (hemicelluloses):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>arabinoxylans (~55%)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>celluloses (9-12%)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>lignins (3-5%)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fructans (3-4%)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>β-glucans (2.2-2.6%).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Most arabinoxylans are water-unextractable, but a smaller part is water-extractable. Cellulose is insoluble and resistant to many microorganisms and enzymes. Celluloses are often associated with lignins and other non-starchy polysaccharides. Together with lignin and other fibers, cellulose forms a lignocellulose, which is highly resistant towards degradation. Fructans and β-glucans are the main components of the soluble fiber.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Xylanase is an enzyme that can degrade or break down the xylans in insoluble fiber and convert them into a simple sugar (xylose), which then can be metabolized by the yeast and lactic acid bacteria. In the end, this makes insoluble fiber less capable of interfering with and diluting the gluten in grains, so the bread won&amp;rsquo;t lose much volume or taste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Amylase is another enzyme that breaks down starches, polysaccharides, and complex carbohydrates into easier-to-absorb simple sugars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Diastatic barley malt packs in amylase and some endogenous xylanase, while wheat bran itself also contains &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf800264a">xylanase and laccase&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Grain kernels themselves usually contain a certain amount of endogenous xylanases for re-modeling and expansion of cell walls during normal cell growth and for more drastic cell wall degradation during seed germination. Additionally, grains also contain microbial xylanases from micro-organisms populating the outer grain kernels layers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Industrial production of xylanases is mostly manufactured via submerged fermentation of lignocellulolytic substrates such as barley husk, corn cobs, hay, wheat bran or straw.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="final-dough">Final dough&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>When you incorporate the levain and the scalded soaker into the final dough, you add every part of the grain back. Not one bit is wasted. Therefore, this bread retains its whole-grain integrity.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>No autolyse this time. I simply amalgamated everything and left the shaggy mess in the fridge overnight, à‎ la Jim Lahey&amp;rsquo;s no-knead method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like working the dough: The gluten in the sifted Karl92 flour had deteriorated to the point where it performed almost like a pastry flour. The dough was very sticky even at such low hydration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you must calculate the hydration percentage:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>excluding levain: 1,000g/1,485g = 67%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>including levain: 1,210g/1,700g = 71%&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The next day, I took the dough out of the fridge and gave it a stretch &amp;amp; fold. Time and cool temperatures worked their magic on the dough &amp;ndash; it was coming together on its own without much manual coaxing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few hours later, I pulled the dough out again and laminated it with caramelized onions (not drained), &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->wheat berries&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->bread spices&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I let the dough rest in the cold until bedtime and gave it a coil-fold. Afterwards, I left it undisturbed in the fridge for 72 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The overall process was basically similar to what I did with the Turkey Red bread, but at a significantly slower pace.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I decided to go for a 72h fermentation for a few reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>to &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1271/bbb.130027">reduce as much mycotoxin&lt;/a> as possible through prolonged lactic acid bacteria fermentation;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to mask the musty smell/taste via developing a complex web of flavors;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to see how long the gluten could hold together before it started to break down.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>72+ hours later, I took the dough out of the fridge and pre-shaped it loosely. The dough had risen by ~30% but felt chock full of air. It hadn&amp;rsquo;t become a soup, so I guess the gluten hadn&amp;rsquo;t collapsed. After a 1-hour bench rest, I shaped it tight (using the reserved 37g coarse bran as coating) and let it proof at room temperature until 100% risen. It took about 5 hours.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Then I baked it as usual, in the toaster oven. The dough weighed 3,187g (7.08 lbs) before baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turned out a monstrous loaf: It measured about 11&amp;quot;x9&amp;quot;x5&amp;quot; and weighed just under 6 lbs. after cooling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hipsters might call this a &lt;em>miche&lt;/em>, a.k.a. the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2017/10/03/new-yorkers-are-paying-20-for-a-loaf-of-bread/">fancy&lt;/a> Parisian way of denoting &amp;ldquo;a supersized rustic sourdough bread,&amp;rdquo; which is in fact a French slang for &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://daysontheclaise.blogspot.com/2009/03/la-miche.html">butt-cheek&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The sweet aroma of freshly baked bread wafted through the whole house &amp;ndash; one of my all-time favorite smells. I let the bread sit in a brown paper bag overnight before slicing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="crumb-reveal">Crumb reveal&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The bread was a breeze to cut into. The knife came out clean. A very distinctive and pleasant fragrance immediately hit the nose.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The crumb turned out much more aerated than in the Turkey Red loaf and had some large holes; it was also much lighter and fluffier, although a bit less moist, than the TR. (High hydration level promotes bigger holes, but the high percentage of whole grain flours works against them.)&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t want to sound like a food snob, but I have to confess that the only words I could think of when slicing this bread were &amp;ldquo;alveolate ecstasy.&amp;rdquo; Each slice felt ethereal, almost weightless, on my hand. In any case, this was a great crumb for sandwiches and toasts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now, the flavor: I was struck first by the tender, airy texture &amp;ndash; so delicate on my tongue that it felt like eating cottony clouds &amp;ndash; although there was some nice chew, too.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Like the Turkey Red loaf, there was little wheat flavor. Maybe there was, but it was easily overshadowed by a prominent combination of sourness and tanginess. I would describe it as noticeably more tangy than sour &amp;ndash; it likely contained a wider spectrum of piquancy than I could articulate &amp;ndash; and I would compare it to a sour rye bread or even a tamarind/lemon juice combination. Call it a &lt;em>pane picante integrale&lt;/em>?&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The brisk flavors of caramelized onions (or was it the wild onions looming in the Karl92?) and crushed spices came through and were nearly assertive enough to go &lt;em>mano a mano&lt;/em> with the lush tartness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wheat berries had literally melted into the crumb and were content to stay in the background.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img loading="lazy"
src="https://breadbuster.github.io/img/dr-funkenstein/20201018_2149.jpg"

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The crust was thin, crispy, and chewy except for the ears which crunched. It tasted much more flavorful than the crumb, as usual, and added the nuttiness I always enjoy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, I think the long, cold fermentation resulted in a fortified crust giving way to richly complex layers of bold, indulgent, sophisticated flavors. Lots of nutty, earthy and sweet overtones followed by a deep tanginess and a trace of pleasing bitterness. I&amp;rsquo;m a &lt;em>huge&lt;/em> fan of zing and heat, and this bread hit the spot!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Best part: I didn&amp;rsquo;t smell or taste any mustiness in it no matter how hard I tried, nor did we feel sick at all from eating it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We devoured half of the loaf in 3 days (delicious as is, but even better toasted), and took the rest to a BBQ at the relatives yesterday. They all grew up eating pre-sliced Wonder Bread (or Bunny® Bread, which &amp;ndash; I just learned yesterday &amp;ndash; has been a household name and an &lt;a href="https://orangebeanindiana.com/2020/05/08/thats-what-i-said-the-story-of-bunny-bread/">iconic brand&lt;/a> in the Midwest for decades, no offense) and have vastly different food preferences than me.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Everybody loved the texture of the bread; they thought it was almost as soft and fluffy as the premium mediocre Bunny® Original 100% Whole Wheat Bread! Lol. This may sound like an insult to a coastal foodie, but in a Midwestern context it must be interpreted as the highest form of compliment &amp;ndash; because &amp;ldquo;you can&amp;rsquo;t beat the Bunny!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However, nobody liked the pungent flavor of this bread. Someone compared it to balsamic vinegar, and someone else said it tasted as sour as Trolli sour gummy worms (&amp;ldquo;for people who can&amp;rsquo;t get enough tanginess in their life&amp;rdquo;). Still, the bread disappeared quickly &amp;ndash; maybe people just got intense carb cravings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh well. That was fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Guess I have just found another failproof (and easier) way of making whole wheat &amp;ldquo;clouds,&amp;rdquo; besides the method I accidentally discovered while making &lt;em>panettone integrale&lt;/em>. What I have done with Karl92 over the last couple of weeks &amp;ndash; from smoking the flour to sifting to the 72h fermentation &amp;ndash; is fairly labor-intensive and time-consuming, not something I&amp;rsquo;d do often or use for production. Just a science experiment for my own curiosity.&lt;/p>

The moment Richard told me he had local Turkey Red, I was hooked. I had no idea Turkey Red could be grown in central Missouri.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Richard shared a lot of stories about local agriculture: growing hard wheats in Missouri is more challenging than selling bicycles in Alaska, because of the climate, soil, distribution, uncompetitive commercial potential, dearth of local interests, etc. The University of Missouri is far less keen on hard wheat trials and researches than Kansas and Nebraska.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Richard also gave me a nice tour of his farm, and kindly offered me a sample of his freshly milled organic Turkey Red flour (85% extraction) to try. This batch of Turkey Red was grown by Paul Lehmann, an organic farmer in Fayette (~25 miles northwest of CoMo).&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="the-og-american-wheat">The OG American wheat&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Turkey Red is a type of hard red winter wheat brought to Kansas by Mennonite immigrants from Russia, the part now known as Ukraine, in the late 1870s. It ended up becoming the primary wheat variety grown in the Midwest for the next ~70 years. It grew especially well in Kansas and, by the early 20th century, was planted in more than 75% of the fields. (Hard red winter wheat was widely grown in the Great Plains area with Kansas as the center, and became known as &amp;ldquo;Kansas wheat.&amp;quot;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After World War II, as industrial farming and the &amp;ldquo;Green Revolution&amp;rdquo; started taking hold, this heritage variety faded away. Wheat began to be hybridized for yield and depend on the application of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, etc. The increase in productivity, in many cases, come at the cost of flavor and nutrition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is speculation that the changes made during hybridization altered the protein and gluten structure of the grain, which has made modern hybrid wheat more difficult to digest and is thought to be the cause of gluten-intolerence in many people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike modern high-yielding dwarf wheat varieties, Turkey Red grows very tall, creating lots of straw and biomass for the soil. It&amp;rsquo;s a landrace variety, i.e. it contains genetic diversity making it adaptable across bio-regions. Fortunately, Turkey Red seeds were saved and this heritage wheat is making a comeback in many parts of the Midwest. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the most popular revival wheats used by US bakers, treasured for its flavor and digestibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is actually a museum in Goessel, Kansas dedicated to the Mennonite farmers who brought over Turkey Red seeds from Russia in 1874.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sift 450g of the 85% extraction Turkey Red flour into&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>400g flour (~75% extraction)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>50g bran &amp;amp; germ
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>40g: for hot soaker&lt;/li>
&lt;li>10g: for dusting later&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Even though the 85% extraction flour has already been sifted, it still contains a fair amount of the bran and germ which can&amp;rsquo;t be milled as finely as the starch and can stand in the way of gluten formation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, you want to hang on to every bit of these, because they contain important nutrients as well as a nuanced flavor from the local terroir.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Make a scalded soaker:&lt;/p>

&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Mix well and autolyze at 60°F for ~6 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="7pm">7pm&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>After ~6 hours of cool autolyse, mix the final dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add 88g of stiff whole wheat levain (60% hydration). Slap &amp;amp; fold for 5-7 mins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add the salt and 20g of water (&lt;em>bassinage&lt;/em>), mix and squeeze for another 5-10 mins until completely absorbed. The dough is very tacky but should start to feel some strength by the end of this mixing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Place the worked dough in a fridge (44°F) immediately. Cold bulk-ferment for the next 14 hours. Do 3 sets of stretch &amp;amp; fold, at 30 minutes apart, during the first 2 hours. My dough felt very extensible, although not very strong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the 3-hour mark, laminate the dough with spent grains (not drained) à la German &lt;em>biertreberbrot&lt;/em> and chopped raisins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My dough almost passed the &amp;ldquo;windowpane&amp;rdquo; test!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the 4-hour mark, perform a coil-fold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remove 10g of the dough and put in an aliquot jar for easy measuring. Place the aliquot next to the dough in the same bowl, and return both to the fridge. Leave them undisturbed overnight.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h4 id="day-3">Day 3&lt;/h4>
&lt;h5 id="9am">9am&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Remove the dough from fridge, and pre-shape via a loose coil-fold. Both the dough and the aliquot have risen a little bit overnight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rest for 45-60 minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="10am">10am&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Shape the dough tightly and place in a proofing vessle. I put mine in a loaf pan lined with parchment paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let the dough rest for 2-3 hours at room temperature, until the aliquot portion has risen nearly 100%. Mine took ~3 hours to get there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Note&lt;/code>: Watch the dough not the clock! Move at the dough&amp;rsquo;s pace.&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="1pm-1">1pm&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Time to bake!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did 15 minutes at 375F in the toaster oven, followed by another 35 minutes at 300F.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dough had a pretty decent oven spring. It actually rose more than I expected and emitted some intoxicating wheat aroma!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After 24 hours of cooling and curing, came the moment of truth&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crunchy crust has softened overnight and is quite easy to cut into. The knife comes out mostly clean.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The crumb is fairly open. No gaping holes, but a very nice texture. Moist, tender, pillowy, and springy. I&amp;rsquo;m surprised how light it is.&lt;/p>

alt="85% extraction Turkey Red wheat bread"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The crumb surrounding the raisins tastes mildly tangy but flavorful &amp;ndash; almost like a small amount of caraway seeds and cinnamon has been added. Scattered raisins give you random bursts of sweetness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The spent grains impart a subtle malty flavor and nutty crunch every now and then when you hit a berry. In case you are wondering, it does not taste like beer at all. You just get some extra fiber from the spent grains.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The crust is thin, crisp, chewy and firm, and tastes much more flavorful (sweet, cinnamony notes).&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The extended hydration of bran and long autolyse really helped with gluten development. The dough needed quite a bit of coaxing at the beginning, but gradually fell into place. A cool, long fermentation helped to develop a light texture and a complex flavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, this is a wheaty loaf that doesn&amp;rsquo;t taste dense or earthy like other almost whole wheat loaves. It has a lingering flavor that is just incredible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This Turkey Red from CoMo is absolutely delicious. The high-quality soil these grains are grown in and the freshness of the flour contribute a rich, unmistakable nuttiness and depth of flavor to the bread.&lt;/p>

I had no idea that bread was something you could make at home. Prior to that, my experience with bread had been exclusively limited to the typical white mush served at school cafeterias. It was so disgustingly bland, empty, and unfulfilling &amp;ndash; not to mention it was also emblematic of everything that was wrong with America &amp;ndash; that I developed a sort of White Bread PTSD and swore I&amp;rsquo;d never eat another slice of bread after college.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Funny how the Covid lockdown has inspired/forced a lot of people to bake breads at home &amp;ndash; and even sell their homemade breads on Etsy. It has forced me to pay more attention to where I source my food from and whether they will always be available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A number of artisan-ish bakeries across the country are selling their bread flours nicely packaged in eco-friendly brown paper bags at &amp;ldquo;pandemic special&amp;rdquo; prices, to make up for their lost business &amp;amp; revenue due to the shutdown and retain customer relationships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last month, King Arthur Flour rebranded itself to King Arthur Baking Company. The flour company was founded in 1790, and is America&amp;rsquo;s first flour company. They have re-aligned the company to reflect their mission &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;bake joy.&amp;rdquo; King Arthur is now a lifestyle company, like Lululemon, Peloton and Chipotle. I don&amp;rsquo;t buy King Arthur&amp;rsquo;s flours or care for its recipes, but I do find that rebranding &amp;ndash; particularly the timing &amp;ndash; interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Literally every state has a &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo; flagship producer. IL has Janie&amp;rsquo;s. NY has Farmer Ground Flour. OR has Camas Country Mill. NC has Carolina Ground. TX has Barton Springs Mill. AZ has Hayden Flour Mills. Who is MO&amp;rsquo;s local artisan flagship producer?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I were going to bring coastal friends &amp;ldquo;Missouri-grown&amp;rdquo; non-touristy gifts, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know what to get &amp;ndash; other than t-ravs, provel, and maybe some local booze. I know the MO Department of Agriculture has a program called Missouri Grown, but the local goodies gift box it has put together is a joke.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Missouri always feels like a giant black hole of locally grown grains. Sure, Missouri grows a ton of soybeans, corn and soft wheat. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s a Corn Belt state. But most of them are exported via the Mississippi River, and the rest processed into animal feed, industrial inputs, and biofuels. Only a tiny percentage stays local. The US Soybean Export Council and American Soybean Association (which has a political action committee called SoyPAC) are both headquartered in St. Louis (STL). Monsanto was founded in STL and headquartered here for over 100 years, and its new parent, Bayer AG, still established its North American HQ here. The world&amp;rsquo;s biggest grain traders &amp;ndash; Archer Daniel Midland (ADM), Bunge, and Cargill &amp;ndash; all have major operations in STL as well. (These 3, along with Louis Dreyfus, control ~90% of global grain trade and have enormous power over grain prices.) Evidently, their presence here impacts local farmers and agri-food system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Missouri certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a shortage of local producers, and the flagship local product with (inter)national recognition doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be bread wheat &amp;ndash; South Carolina has done exceptionally well with heirloom rice renaissance, for example.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I had the good fortune of living a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw away from Anson Mills in Charleston for a number of years, and got to witness its metamorphosis to the Palmetto State&amp;rsquo;s flagship artisan producer/purveyor, an explosive commercial success with international fame. Tourists from all over the world flock to Charleston, SC to visit Anson Mills and experience the antebellum culinary past. It has become a culinary tourist destination in and of itself. More incredibly, the entrepreneurs behind Anson Mills are not even SC natives. What&amp;rsquo;s the MO equivalent of Anson Mills or Carolina Gold rice, or of even San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Tartine? My point is, MO local producers have a branding/PR problem. Tom Cruise is a globally recognizable brand. Janie&amp;rsquo;s of Illinois is a national brand. What&amp;rsquo;s the most recognizable MO brand? The only local product brand (even remotely) familiar to people from out of state or overseas might be Hammons Black Walnuts, which does have a D2C web store, but its branding and packaging leave a lot to be desired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kansas City (the Wheat Belt&amp;rsquo;s buckle) seems rife for a &amp;ldquo;single-origin wheat&amp;rdquo; renaissance that will help rebuild &lt;a href="https://thecounter.org/rural-kansas-depopulation-commodity-agriculture/">local economy&lt;/a> and reclaim the Wheat State&amp;rsquo;s agricultural heritage. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Kansas City had dozens of flour mills. Grain magnate Frank A. Theis (namesake of Theis Park) wrote in a 1938 article in The Kansas City Star, &amp;ldquo;No other industry, directly or indirectly, has been more closely identified with the growth of Kansas City.&amp;rdquo; In South Carolina and North Carolina, the cultivation of revival grains is a rapidly expanding enterprise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I desperately wanted to find a Missouri-grown bread wheat. I went on a relentless hunt for this elusive prize, with little success. All neighboring states grow bread wheats, why not Missouri? My curiosity took me down a rabbit hole&amp;hellip; What started out as a seemingly trivial question turned into a herculean quest and then Mission Impossible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously, most people buy flours, not grains. So flour was where I started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bearded guitarist and baker used to sell his sourdough breads at farmers' markets and some restaurants in STL. One of his breads was &lt;em>pan bigio&lt;/em>, an Italian country loaf made with &amp;ldquo;local Cape Girardeau whole wheat flour.&amp;rdquo; I tried to find out which Cape Girardeau farm/mill that was (since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware there even was one), but he shut down his operations in March and went dark.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I called up the few artisan-ish bakeries in STL that pride themselves on using &amp;ldquo;locally grown and milled wheat&amp;rdquo; to ask what flours they use and where they source them from. Not only did they refuse to tell me anything, but also they got very confused and in some cases suspicious&amp;hellip; as if I had broken an unspoken cultural taboo. One of the nicer bakers directed me to the proverbial purveyors of &amp;ldquo;unique local organic artisanal products,&amp;rdquo; aka. specialty retailers that label everything with 10+ &lt;em>haute&lt;/em> adjectives and lists everything 1,000% higher than MSRP. Well, that was a very curious experience. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether these bakeries 1) genuinely use local ingredients as much as they claim, 2) severely lack business acumen to begin with, or 3) are simply too small-minded and uncreative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went back to the drawing board and started doing some research, when I found out that the band, from Delaware, Maryland, northern Virginia and southern Illinois and through Missouri to the eastern part of Kansas, is known for growing soft winter wheat. In fact, whatever wheat ends up flourishing on a commercially viable scale in Missouri is usually soft winter wheat and mostly exported, although Mizzou Cooperative Extension&amp;rsquo;s hard winter wheat trials in several locations around the state are successful. Most of the commercial bakeries here source their bread flours by truckloads from western Kansas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a few days of hopeless internet research, I was on the verge of giving up. Serendipitously, a couple of small farms in central/western MO came across my radar &amp;ndash; they grow organic hard red winter wheat!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this is how I found 180 Farms in Sweet Springs, MO. I called up Greg Guier earlier last week week, to inquire about his organic wheat berries. Holy shit, Greg is one of the nicest and most down-to-earth people I&amp;rsquo;ve ever talked to. Some Midwesterners are just frighteningly friendly! He told me this year&amp;rsquo;s Warthog Red, a hard red winter wheat, was still being harvested and would be ready in a few days, and last year&amp;rsquo;s Darby White, a hard white winter wheat, was readily available. He said he delivers only to Kansas City, because he tried for years to set up delivery arrangements in STL but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get anyone interested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was going camping in the Ozarks this weekend anyway, so I took a detour and stopped by Greg&amp;rsquo;s farm to scoop up some freshly harvested Warthog wheat berries. (Heck, even swung by the Overland Park Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market and procured some heritage Meishan pork from Odd Bird Farm in Weston, MO.) Turns out, that was a great decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Warthog is a modern HRWW with a moderate protein content (10%-11%). I remember Warthog was hugely popular at the NYC Greenmarket a few years ago (thanks to GrowNYC Grains, a distributor/hub that promotes and sells local grains in the Northeast). Farmer-miller Thor Oechsner planted Warthog for the first time in 2010, loved it, and grew to become the largest Warthog producer in the Northeast. Then Janie&amp;rsquo;s Mill picked it up, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did read about Warthog&amp;rsquo;s relatively low protein level for a HRWW, and kept that in mind while working with the flour. In fact, Oechsner recommended blending Warthog with a spring wheat flour to boost protein content while letting Warthog&amp;rsquo;s special flavor shine through.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nah. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go Warthog all the way through.&lt;/p>

&lt;tr>

&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>The science behind incorporating orange juice and diastatic malt is explained in a later &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/desert-dynamo/">post&lt;/a>. TL;DR: Diastatic malt increases the conversion of starches to sugar, boosting the caramelization of the crust. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in orange juice tightens the gluten network and gives the bread a better rise.&lt;/p>

I traveled to the island a few months after Hurricane Maria. A lot of businesses on the island were closed, and people were running out of everything &amp;ndash; much like everywhere in the world right now, as a result of the Covid lockdown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back in Viejo San Juan, I stumbled across a community event on sustainable agriculture called Agro + Cultura. I hung out there all day as probably the only &amp;ldquo;no hablo español&amp;rdquo; attendee, and fumbled my way through a few classes on canning taught by the &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/0J0Dq">Queer Kitchen Brigade&lt;/a>. It was there and then that I made &lt;em>kimchi&lt;/em> for the first time in my life, and learned about the difference between pickling and fermentation. It didn&amp;rsquo;t click with me, until my contacts introduced me to a local politician (who was formerly a very high-ranking official at the broadly powerful &lt;em>Banco Gubernamental de Fomento para Puerto Rico&lt;/em>, a &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/lxHU6">driving force&lt;/a> behind Puerto Rico&amp;rsquo;s debt crisis). In private, he bashed solar energy and dismissed local grassroots agricultural resilience movements as &amp;ldquo;inefficient and ineffective,&amp;rdquo; and said the island &amp;ndash; which imports ~90% of its food and raw materials &amp;ndash; was &amp;ldquo;better off left alone to big corporations.&amp;rdquo; That was a wake-up call for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s how I got interested in fermentation, as a way to preserve food and build resilience. I grew up with food insecurity. Even though I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate enough to have not experienced scarcity since college, I worry I could again someday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stories about bread lines outside food pantries across the country make me feel tremendously grateful to have learned different methods of food preservation during the golden age of American farming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the last few years, America&amp;rsquo;s agricultural abundance allowed me to indulge my curiosity, fortuitously at a time when commodity and consumer prices hit a new decade low. I was completely unaware that the world economy was going through a mild recession in 2019. I was able to fill up my pantry with 25-lb. bags of miscellaneous organic (pseudo)grains &amp;ndash; wheat, rye, durum, buckwheat, teff, amaranth, quinoa, corn, barley, oat, millet, sorghum, etc. &amp;ndash; at rock-bottom prices, just a few months before Covid. I remember Aldi was selling 5-lb. bags of all purpose flour for ~$1 back then (it costs $2.12 as of November 2022). With so much grains on hand, I made a lot of rejuvelac and built a sourdough starter from scratch. That was the beginning of my breadmaking journey.&lt;/p>

In 1845, wheat was grown in every country of New York. There were even four acres of wheat grown in Manhattan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New Jersey was one of the &amp;ldquo;bread colonies,&amp;rdquo; where wheat was an important export crop for farmers.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>During Colonial times the wheat belt in New Jersey stretched from New York City to Philadelphia. By 1750 the New Jersey colony had progressed rapidly in milling, and much of the flour marketed in New York City came from the region around New Brunswick. In the first half of the 18th century the New Jersey flouring mills were considered as the best in the country.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Harry B. Weiss, &lt;em>The Early Grist and Flouring Mills of New Jersey&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In his book, &lt;em>The Third Plate&lt;/em>, Chef Dan Barber mentions that there was one gristmill for every seven hundred Americans in 1840.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The remains of those mills can still be seen along the banks of the Garden State&amp;rsquo;s rivers and major streams. In gristmills, grains were ground between millstones, which crushed the entire kernel (bran, germ, and endosperm) into flour. Once ground, flour had a shelf life of about 1 week. You brought your wheat to the mill or you milled it yourself. Some of the bran and germ could be sifted out, but the volatile oils in the remaining bran and germ turn rancid quickly through exposure to oxygen, reducing the shelf life of stone-ground flour. The invention of the modern roller mill in the late 1800s enabled millers to strip the bran and germ from the endosperm during milling &amp;ndash; and, in the process, remove most of the nutrients and flavors. Flour changed from a locally produced, perishable food into a high-volume, shelf-stable commodity. Many local farmers and millers were unable to compete against large-scale highly-efficient grain operations in the Midwest. By 1955, only &lt;a href="https://morrisparks.net/index.php/parks/cooper-gristmill">one&lt;/a> flour mill remained in New Jersey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Re-localization of food supply chains has been underway across the world, to promote food sovereignty. The economics of local grains could work. There is a farmer in Ontario who makes a living selling his hand-processed grains direct to consumers. Thor Oechsner, an organic grain farmer in New York, built a mill (Farmer Ground Flour) and a bakery (Wide Awake Bakery) to ensure markets for his grains. Regional hubs and distributors like GrowNYC Grains and The Northeast Grainshed have been pivotal in connecting growers with processors and bakers, and sparking a rise in demand for local grains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IMHO, the success of re-localizing grains and flours largely depends on the willingness of bakers to develop a sensory approach to baking, i.e. understand the differences in gluten content, water absorption and flavor in locally-grown grains and locally-milled flours, which lack the consistency that large industrial mills achieve by blending different varieties of wheat. By foregoing strict adherence to recipes, bakers are liberated from the expectation that flour must behave consistently, regardless of the origin, farming practices and conditions in which the grain is grown. They would be able to better accommodate variability in the way locally-grown grains perform during the making of breads and pastries.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The white flour industrial complex so completely dominates the food landscape&amp;hellip;that to wish for anything substantially different seems, well, wishful and nostalgic.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have been working my way through Pyotr Kropotkin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Conquest of Bread&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to forget that bread shortages helped ignite the French Revolution and the Arab Spring. Kropotkin&amp;rsquo;s call for &amp;ldquo;well-being for all&amp;rdquo; has inspired me to think about how to repurpose old bread into new meals, essentially &amp;ldquo;paying it forward&amp;rdquo; so that nothing is wasted and someone could always have a loaf of bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>German bakers have long had a tradition of adding an old bread soaker to a new dough. It helps to eliminate waste, save on fresh flours, and add buckets of flavors. Pretty clever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before you wrinkle your nose and scream &amp;ldquo;ewwwwwww,&amp;rdquo; the old bread used here is not a green and fuzzy piece of ancient crust, or a 3-day-old slice of supermarket pap, but a drying piece of good (sourdough) bread, e.g. the end of a loaf.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a delicious way to upcycle a good amount of old bread into a new loaf.&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>To make roasted barley tea, first you gotta roast the barley. Spread whole, from-the-field, unhulled barley in a single layer on a sheet pan and place in oven. (I used unhulled Baronesse barley from Joseph&amp;rsquo;s Grainery, WA. It was bred by &lt;a href="http://www.nordsaat.de/ueber-uns/historie/?L=1">Nordsaat&lt;/a> in Germany where they don&amp;rsquo;t care about feed grains as much as in the US.) Roast at 400°F for 15-20 mins, or until the grains take on a golden brown color and exude a popcorn-like aroma. Let cool and store in an air-tight container. Now you can brew some scrumptious tea by steeping roasted barley in hot water for ~12 hours. This cannot be reproduced with pearled or naked barley, since much of the flavor comes from the roasted toasty hull.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Steam or roast some chopped beets. Pulse the cooked beets with coconut milk in a blender until smooth and creamy. The beetroot purée will add extra flavors and delightful swirls to the bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soak the chunks of stale bread (can be any type) in 25% of the total tea. (Depending on how dry your bread is, you may want to adjust the hydration accordingly.) Add half of the levain. Leave in a fridge overnight. Next day, mash up any remaining lumps so that it&amp;rsquo;s a thick and somewhat smooth paste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Autolyze the freshly milled flour with the remaining tea for 2 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mix in the soaker, the rest of the levain, and salt, until thoroughly combined.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rest 30 mins. Do a strong letter fold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rest another 30 mins rest. Laminate with beetroot purée to add extra flavors and colorful swirls to the bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rest 60 mins. Perform a coil-fold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rest another 2 hours before shaping. Roll the dough in seeds. No need to toast the seeds, as they will be nicely toasted during baking and add amazing flavors to the bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>10 hours final proof in the fridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let the dough warm up for a few hours before baking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It rose like a beast in the oven.&lt;/p>

It cost ~$2/lb, not cheap but not ridiculously overpriced either. The Glenn wheat was grown on Kenter Canyon Farms in Ventura County, along the south side of the Santa Clara River.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/files/Glenn.pdf">Glenn&lt;/a> is a modern HRSW developed by a NDSU breeding program to provide better scab resistance and higher yield. It was released by the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station in the spring of 2005. It has a fairly high protein content of 13%-14%. I have seen quite a few local and regional mills across the country label Glenn as a &amp;ldquo;heritage&amp;rdquo; wheat &amp;ndash; very curious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had long wanted to bake a &lt;em>treberbrot&lt;/em>, a hearty German bread made with the addition of spent grains from brewing beers. The spent grain adds some sweetness, texture and a lot of fiber to the bread.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>First, I milled the Glenn wheat berries, and &lt;a href="https://breadbuster.github.io/posts/joeliath/">sifted&lt;/a> half into a 80% extraction flour, leaving the other half wholegrain (100% extraction).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, I built a levain with&lt;/p>

&lt;li>sifted-out wheat bran; and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a smooth purée of spent grains (from brewing Berliner Weiss) and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvtmBuTyu1c">boiled jackfruit seeds&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>To make the dough stronger, I decided to use a 2-dough lamination method.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I did 4 folds with each dough during the first 3 hours. Then I combined both doughs by gently stretching them out into big rectangles and placing dough #2 on top of dough #1. I sprinkled the add-ins during lamination.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s already December. Where did the year go?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In review, 2019 has been my Year of Fermentation. I read Sandor Katz&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>The Art of Fermentation&lt;/em> and René Redzepi&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>The Noma Guide to Fermentation.&lt;/em> I got into sourdough breadmaking (and bread chemistry) seriously for the firs time. I experimented audaciously with literally anything I could get my hands on: vegetables, beans, grains, milk, fish&amp;hellip; From lactic acid bacteria (LAB), I ventured into fungi &amp;ndash; koji (&lt;em>Aspergillus oryzae&lt;/em>) and tempeh (&lt;em>Rhizopus oligosporus&lt;/em>). It&amp;rsquo;s been a very memorable year and an unbelievably fulfilling one.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Broom Rider</title><link>/posts/broom-rider/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2019 15:59:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>/posts/broom-rider/</guid><description>A powerfully tasty broom for your colon.</description><content>&lt;p>In Deuteronomy 8:8, the Lord promised the Israelites a land &amp;ldquo;of wheat and barley.&amp;rdquo; And it was five barley loaves that Jesus divided to feed the five thousand in the story of &amp;ldquo;the loaves and the fishes.&amp;rdquo; Many people are familiar with the mild, nutty flavor of barley in soup and stews, but few have probably eaten barley in a bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ancient Greeks had a method of divination using barley cakes or loaves of barley bread. It&amp;rsquo;s called alphitomancy (&amp;ldquo;álphito&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;barley&amp;rdquo;), and the diviner who used barley is a &lt;em>alphitómantis&lt;/em>. A quantity of pure barley was kneaded with milk, a little salt and without leaven. Then it was wrapped up in a greased paper, baked directly in a fire, and rubbed with verbena leaf when finished. When someone in a group was suspected of a crime, all of the suspects would be fed slices of this barley bread, as it was assumed that those innocent could eat it perfectly, while the guilty person would choke and get indigestion. On certain days of the year, young women would enter the woods carrying cakes made of barley and honey. It was said that the devil led the women into the woods. Supposedly, the serpent ate the cakes of the innocent women, but refused the cakes of the others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A &amp;ldquo;barleycorn&amp;rdquo; is an English unit of length based on the size of a dried grain of barley. One inch was defined as being equal to three barleycorns. Used as early as the 10th century in Britain, it was mostly replaced by imperial units through the Weights and Measures Act of 1824. But the barleycorn legacy remains &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s still used as the basis of shoe sizes in English-speaking countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the Irish Rebellion of 1798 (known as &lt;em>Éirí Amach 1798&lt;/em> in the Irish and &lt;em>The Hurries&lt;/em> in Ulster Scots), soldiers often carried barley in their pockets as provisions when on the march. Every spring after the rebellion, the folklore goes, small fields of barley would sprout and mark &amp;ldquo;croppy-holes,&amp;rdquo; unmarked mass graves into which these man were thrown in. To many Irish nationalists, barley growing every spring from these &amp;ldquo;croppy-holes&amp;rdquo; symbolized the regenerative nature of Irish resistance to British rule. The Irish poet Robert Dwyer Joyce wrote a ballad to memorialize the soldiers, titled &amp;ldquo;The Wind That Shakes the Barley.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Caffè d&amp;rsquo;orzo was a coffee substitute in Italy during the two World Wars, made mainly
from finely ground roasted barley. It&amp;rsquo;s still a popular drink today, and marketed worldwide as a healthy (naturally caffeine-free) and delicious Italian alternative to coffee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The modern word &amp;ldquo;barn&amp;rdquo; comes from the Old English word &amp;ldquo;bærlic&amp;rdquo;, which means &amp;ldquo;of
barley.&amp;rdquo; You see, all of our barns are really just barley houses. Until ~200 years ago, barley was probably the No.1 bread grain of continental Europe and was carried to the New World by the early settlers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Barley (&lt;em>Hordeum vulgare L.&lt;/em>) has a thick fibrous hull, a high level of ß-glucans and simply-arranged starch granules. Over the last half-century, worldwide production of wheat has quadrupled while the production of barley has barely doubled. Global production of barley is about 30% of that of corn. Compared to corn, barley has more protein, methionine, lysine, cysteine and tryptophan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Barley has been cultivated and consumed since ancient times. But why hasn&amp;rsquo;t it been granted the same &amp;ldquo;ancient grain&amp;rdquo; status that einkorn, emmer, and spelt now enjoy?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, barley is cultivated mostly as animal feed, with two uses: grain yield and grazing. For ruminants, barley is the third most readily degradable cereal behind oats and wheat, and has a more rapid starch fermentation rate than corn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The world&amp;rsquo;s most nutritious barley is said to be grown in the Red River Valley, a beautiful stretch of land between the rolling plains of North Dakota and the lakes and forests of Minnesota. It isn&amp;rsquo;t your traditional valley &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s nestled on flat, fertile ground that follows the coils of the mighty Red River as it flows north from South Dakota to Canada. The soil is what sets the Red River Valley apart. The rich, dark soil produces barley that contains the highest amounts of protein and other nutrients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The value-added market for barley is in malting and beer production, and as such the malting and brewing industry has set the quality specifications for barley grain being delivered after harvest. The key malt trait is hot water extract (HWE). High levels of HWE are desirable, as it provides an indication of malt quality as well as potential brewhouse performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Malted barley is used for brewing ales and lagers, pilsners, IPAs and pale ales. Besides providing the sugars that get fermented into alcohol, malts and grains provide a full range of flavors in beer &amp;ndash; from light cracker, toast, and biscuit to coffee, dark chocolate, dried fruits and brown sugar. Malt is what gives a beer color, richness, and complexity. It&amp;rsquo;s obviously a key ingredient for breweries, yet nearly all domestically malted barley comes just from a few companies &amp;ndash; Rahr, Briess, Cargill, and Great Western. In recent years, craft maltsters have been on the rise, but craft malt is still a tiny fraction of overall malt production.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Barley has such a low gluten content that it must be mixed with wheat flour to make a tall, fluffy loaf. The flavor of barley is mild, and the color is a grayish white. It adds a subtle nutty barley flavor to the bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing beats the warm, nutty flavor of toasted flaxseeds. So you should totally toast the flaxseeds first &amp;ndash; in a skillet, oven or microwave &amp;ndash; to bring out the richest flavors they have. Then soak the flaxseeds in milk kefir (could use plain vanilla h₂o, buttermilk, etc). Leave the pudding in the fridge for a few hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gently shake a pinch of cinnamon into the flours. Autolyze with almond milk for 2 hours. You can keep it in the fridge, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add the levain and salt. Mix well until thoroughly combined. Add all of the flaxseed pudding, and mix until evenly distributed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perform 4-5 folds in the next 3 hours. Warm bulk-fermentation should last 5 hours in total.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shape. 18 hours final proof in a fridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let the dough warm up before baking.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Back in my college days, whenever I needed to pull some all-nighters, I would always chew on a handful of chocolate-covered Colombian coffee beans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A while ago, I got some Ethiopian Amaro Gayo green coffee beans. I roasted them at home until just after the first crack, and have been drinking the cold brew as my summer morning Joe. It&amp;rsquo;s acidic, floral and citrusy, reminding me of orange marmalade and cocoa.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The zero-waster in me couldn&amp;rsquo;t stand the thought of just throwing out these spent coffee grounds, so memories of chewing gourmet coffee beans in college gave me the idea of incorporating these spent coffee grounds into baked goods. ☕🍞&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Danish startup has come up with &lt;a href="https://www.kaffebueno.com/post/introducing-kaffe-bueno-coffee-flour">Kaffe Bueno Flour&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Kaffe Bueno Flour® comes from used coffee grounds, recycled from selected hotels and offices in Copenhagen. Then, we extract the oil inside the grounds and further sterilise them. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The result is a naturally gluten-free coffee flour. Although it comes from coffee, its coffee taste is mostly gone along with the oil extracted. Its taste leans towards nutty, chocolaty side. &lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>They even have a &lt;a href="https://www.kaffebueno.com/post/how-to-make-sourdough-bread-with-coffee-flour-vegan-recipe">recipe&lt;/a> for a coffee sourdough, in which the coffee flour is ~11% of flour weight in the final dough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dan Lepard has a formula for his famous &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190908145402/https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/dan-lepard-s-black-pepper-rye">Black Pepper Rye&lt;/a>, which uses brewed black coffee to make a roux with a rye first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, on the spur of the moment, I strained some coffee grounds from my cold brew, and left them to dry over a dehumidifier for a few hours. When the grounds were thoroughly dry, I ground them again in a coffee grinder to yield a much finer &amp;ldquo;coffee flour.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="white-wheat--white-flour">White wheat =/= white flour&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I wanted to use mild-tasting flour for this bread, so the coffee flavor can come through. Colorado Windy White, a modern hard white winter wheat (HWWW) variety grown by Sunflower Acres (the retail front is Grains from the Plains), fits the bill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you grind up white wheat to make flour, it looks off-white, kind of like unbleached &amp;ldquo;white flour.&amp;rdquo; But they are not the same thing. Most commercial white flour is made from red wheat that has been refined (the bitter, bulky parts of bran and germ are removed, leaving only the starchy endosperm) &amp;ndash; and in most cases it has been treated with bleach and potassium bromate, and then &amp;ldquo;enriched&amp;rdquo; with artificial vitamins since the natural ones have been lost during processing. This results in a homogeneous product with a long shelf life, which produces consistently fluffy baked goods &amp;ndash; but at the cost of nutrition and flavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>White wheat is pretty much the same as red wheat, except that it has no major genes for bran color. White whole wheat flour has a milder, sweeter flavor than red whole wheat flour, due to lack of phenolic compounds and lower tannin content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the US, many breads are made with hard white (whole) wheat containing &amp;gt;= 10% protein:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;li>Brands owned by Flowers Foods, the second largest bakery company in the US: Wonder Bread, Nature&amp;rsquo;s Own, Captain John Derst&amp;rsquo;s, Sunbeam, Evangeline Maid, Mrs. Freshley&amp;rsquo;s, Merita, Cobblestone Mill, European Bakers, Mi Casa, Bunny Bread, HomePride, Tastykake, and Dave&amp;rsquo;s Killer Bread.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Soft white wheat (typically &amp;lt; 10% protein) is the star ingredient in Kellogg&amp;rsquo;s Mini Wheats and Wheat Flakes, as well as Nabisco&amp;rsquo;s Triscuit crackers. Kellogg&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Open for Breakfast&amp;rdquo; website tells the stories of a 4,000-acre soft white wheat farm in Michigan, close to the company&amp;rsquo;s HQ. There is some evidence that breakfast cereals made with white whole wheat hold their crispness longer in milk. Triscuit&amp;rsquo;s product description goes, &amp;ldquo;We like to think of Soft White Winter Wheat as a kind of cashmere of wheat because of its soft texture and delicious taste. It&amp;rsquo;s what gives Triscuit its golden color, distinctive crunch and 24 grams of delicious whole grain goodness per serving.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Asians love soft white wheat, too, because they believe it makes better noodles &amp;ndash; bright, clear white, soft inside but firm on the surface. When made with white wheat, fresh refrigerated noodles will not develop black specks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Japanese prefecture Kagawa, the home of the &lt;em>udon&lt;/em> noodle, a white wheat reclamation is underway. Before the 1960s, fields of wheat covered the town of Sanuki (the old name of Kagawa). The local Sanuki wheat would be harvested, milled and sifted to make flour for Sanuki &lt;em>udon&lt;/em>. But after repeated bad weather in the early 1960s, wheat production declined sharply and imported Australian Standard White (ASW) wheat soon became the major variety. Some local noodle makers and aficionados found imported wheat to be inferior and produced subpar &lt;em>udon&lt;/em> flour, so they worked together with small farmers to revive Kagawa&amp;rsquo;s soul food, i.e. &lt;em>udon&lt;/em> made from Sanuki-grown wheat. In 2000, they developed a new variety of wheat for &lt;em>udon&lt;/em> named &lt;em>sanuki no yume&lt;/em> (&amp;ldquo;Sanuki&amp;rsquo;s dream&amp;rdquo;) and later in 2009 a newer variety based on the OG. Since 2013, almost the entire wheat field in Kawaga grows &lt;em>sanuki no yume&lt;/em> 2009. Kinoshita Flour Mills in Kagawa sells a &lt;em>udon&lt;/em> flour made with 100% Kagawa-grown wheat (8.5% protein). They use a meticulous milling process to remove all the bran because, as explained on their website, &amp;ldquo;speck, a small piece of bran, would damage the taste and the food texture of the Udon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They can keep their noodles, I will make bread. There are thousands of other foods I would rather eat. &lt;em>Mon pain quotidien&lt;/em>, first and foremost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="milling">Milling&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Bread made from finely milled wholegrain flour has a tender texture, a slight chew, a rustic hue, and robust wheat flavor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Note&lt;/code>: Working with freshly milled single-varietal whole grains is not as predictable as a standard bag of King Arthur or other name-brand ﬂour, which remain consistent by blending varieties of wheats from multiple years or regions. Whole grains are living and vibrant; shelf-stable flours are dead. Working with whole grains is challenging and requires you to be willing to learn new skills and pay greater attention to the process, rather than relying on recipes where you can simply plug in your ingredients and yield the same results. Grains are a lot like coffee &amp;ndash; you have to think about, &amp;ldquo;When was this roasted? When was this ground?&amp;rdquo; You can taste the difference in ﬂavor and texture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Freshly milled flour works a bit differently from shelf-stable flour:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>It contains more enzymes and minerals, and ferments faster than store-bought ones;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It contains volatile oils from the bran and germ; store-bought flour has had some oils evaporated off or may not even have had the germ in it, depending on the brand.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Freshly milled wholegrain flour is best for Desem, the old Flemish method specifically developed for 100% wholegrain bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="bolting">Bolting&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I ground up the wheat berries in a grain mill, and sifted the flour through a mesh sieve to screen out the coarsest bits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bolted flour contains almost all of the germ, and the softer parts of the bran. In exchange for a loss of mainly fiber and minerals, the resulting flour performs more like a bread or all-purpose flour while maintaining some of the rich flavor, nutritional benefits, and lovely color of wholegrain flours. It has a creamy texture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Historically, bolted flour was sifted through &lt;a href="https://www.angelfire.com/journal/millbuilder/boulting.html">a piece of cloth&lt;/a>. Nowadays it&amp;rsquo;s typically done through a metal or plastic screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The total flour out of the sifter divided by the total flour out of the mill would give you the extraction percentage. The higher the percentage, the closer to whole grain flour it is. 100% extraction is whole wheat. Home-milling and bolting wheat will give you incredible flavor that&amp;rsquo;s impossible to beat.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Do the same thing with whole rye berries &amp;ndash; mill them, but skip the bolting. Leave the rye flour coarse and wholesome. Rye is a cousin to wheat and mills similarly, but the two have very different baking qualities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IMO, rye is one of the tastiest, most nutrient-dense grains. It yields a peppery-earthy flavor and improves the keeping quality of whatever you make with it. Feeding sourdough starter with rye keeps it vigorous, sour and fruity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Abruzzi rye is an Italian heirloom variety. The kernels are bluish-gold in appearance, and smell nutty and sweet like a blend of herbal spices and citrus. It was famous in the Carolinas during the colonial era. Did you know it was the very rye flour used in &amp;ldquo;thirded bread&amp;rdquo;, a cost-cutting recipe that combined rye, wheat, and cornmeal (instead of oats) plus the sweet upgrade of molasses, such as Boston brown bread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Small amounts have big results. Blending merely 5% of rye into a wheat bread will add a depth of flavor, without overpowering others.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="method">Method&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I have a big batch of &lt;em>zakvaska&lt;/em> left from making rye bread &lt;em>kvass&lt;/em>. So I used some &lt;em>zakvaska&lt;/em>, instead of the usual WW sourdough starter, to build a 100% hydration levain for this bread. It doubled in volume overnight, brimming with bubbles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I autolysed all of the flours with coffee for 1 hour. Then I added the levain and salt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did 5 folds during the first 3 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After 5 hours of warm bulk-fermentation, I shaped the dough into a log, coated it with a handful of flaxseeds, and placed it in my ghetto banneton. I left it in the fridge overnight to proof.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next day, I left the dough in a warm place for 2.5 hours to finish proofing. The dough rose 80%-90%, and felt so jiggly! Then I baked it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The bread almost tripled from the initial dough! The crust bloomed nicely from the seams and had beautifully caramelized spots.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h4 id="cooling">Cooling&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The final stage of baking bread is letting it cool properly. If you were to slice into a hot loaf of bread, you would not be doing it any justice. The heat retained inside the bread continues to cook it and develop flavor/texture, so slicing it too early interrupts this process prematurely. Also, cutting warm bread allows moisture to escape into the air, which means it will go stale faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the breads cool, the process of starch retrogradation is completed and the water molecules move outward, evenly, toward the crust. If you were to cut into a hot loaf, the crumb is still too soft and the bread won&amp;rsquo;t slice neatly, it will tend to be gummy and stick to your knife. Allow your loaves to firm up and cool to about body temperature before slicing. Breads that can be eaten while they are still warm are rolls and baguettes, because the crust-to-crumb ratio is so high, and there is not much further internal cooking that has to take place.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h4 id="tasting">Tasting&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The crust is thin and crispy, and the crumb springy and soft. The cold brew coffee lent a nice color to the bread. The coffee flour definitely added a unique bite and a smoky accent. There is no smell or taste of morning Joe, but you can feel the coffee grounds caressing your tongue.&lt;/p>

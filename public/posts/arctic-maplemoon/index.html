<div class=post-content><div>
<p>Just came back from a Christmas vacation in Québec, with a boatload of good memories and bagfuls of grains. Took the Old Canada Road Scenic Byway from Maine to Québec City, and felt like I had teleported across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe.</p>
<p>Québec sits just below the Arctic, which means it&rsquo;s literally frozen half of the year. Holy shit, winter in Québec is cold &ndash; temperatures could easily drop to -35°C (-31°F) with the windchill. I had to get a parka. But I love how Canadians like to one-up each other over how cold their town is, as if winter was an acquired taste.</p>
<p>But Québec &ndash; especially la Ville de Québec &ndash; at Christmastime is a true winter wonderland, full of <em>joie de vivre</em>. It&rsquo;s like Québécois have perfected the art of winter aversion therapy.</p>
<p>Québec is quite different from the rest of Canada (sort of like Scotland vs. England, or Puerto Rico vs. the US mainland). It&rsquo;s a wonder that they have stayed together for this long. Québec gets a bunch of benefits (e.g. tax revenue, currency, and a governmental framework) from Canada that its own constantly-impoverished legislature could never provide, and Canada gets to enjoy a slice of Europe in between Ontario and New Brunswick. Friends with benefits.</p>
<p><em>Au Québec, on parle français.</em> But my French is rusty. Québec&rsquo;s language issues are too deep, and some places absolutely refuse to speak a word of English. I wanted to have a good time and experience Québec City like a local, so I brushed up on my <em>français</em> before arriving.</p>
<p>Holy poutine, Montmorency Falls is actually taller than Niagara Falls and absolutely stunning &ndash; even in the winter. The ice toboggan at Le Château Frontenac was incredibly thrilling and fun.</p>
<p>The two cornerstones of the Québécois cuisine are bread and meat (particularly pork), both of which I&rsquo;m fond of. So I had the good fortune of sampling many local gourmet foods made by <em>les artisans charcutiers</em> and <em>les boulangers des grains nobles</em>. If you&rsquo;ve never had <em>saucissons</em> (&ldquo;French salami&rdquo;) from La Ferme des Quatre-Temps and Charcuterie Charlevoisienne, or cheeses from Fromagerie des Grondines and Laiterie Charlevoix, then you haven&rsquo;t lived!</p>
<p>I found an interesting indie magazine on Québécois food culture, <a href=https://cariboumag.com/>Caribou</a>. Oh, there&rsquo;s also a 5-volume tome about the history of family cooking in Québec, <em>Histoire de la cuisine familiale du Québec</em>.</p>
<p>Given that Québec produces an overwhelming majority of the world&rsquo;s maple syrup (<em>sirop d&rsquo;érable</em>), it&rsquo;s not surprising Québécois drizzle maple syrup on everything, even the eggs.</p>
<p>Anyway, I brought back some La Meunerie Milanaise wheat berries. No clue what specific cultivar these wheat berries are, other than some kind of hard red wheat grown in Québec. The nutrition label says it has 11.11% protein.</p>
<p>According to the Spring 2018 issue of Bread Lines, published by the Bread Baker&rsquo;s Guild of America, La Milanaise whole wheat flour is a blend of hard red winter/spring wheats. The nutrition label says it has 11.67% protein. I doubt La Milanaise uses vastly different blends in its wheat berries and WW flours.</p>
<p>The way the grain industry works in Canada reminds me a lot of America&rsquo;s three-tier system of alcohol distribution: producers sell only to processors, who then sell only through their distributors<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, and distributors sell only to businesses. You rarely know which specific farm the grains come from, let alone meeting the farmers. You can&rsquo;t buy La Milanaise products directly from La Milanaise anymore. You gotta find them at local retailers or place special orders through Avril Supermarché Santé.</p>
<p>I confess I hesitated about buying these wheat berries because I didn&rsquo;t know what cultivars they were or who grew them, which is against <a href=/about>my philosophy</a>, but I decided to fuck it because YOLO&mldr;and it&rsquo;s Canada where the face of flour is Robin Hood, owned by US multinational Cargill.</p>
<p>I also got some La Milanaise oat groats. Québec doesn&rsquo;t exactly grow a lot of oats. There are >=30 organic oat producers in eastern Québec, mostly in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and Bas-Saint-Laurent, but altogether they produce just ~5% of Canada&rsquo;s oats. The Prairies (especially Saskatchewan) produces 93%.</p>
<p>Obviously, Canada is great at growing oats, but not so great at processing them. Most of them are exported as raw commodities. <a href=https://oatcanada.com/>Oat Canada</a> gets its crops from Alberta, but only <em>after</em> the oats have been shipped to a facility in the US or Europe and processed into a concentrated protein powder. That&rsquo;s the Canadian way.</p>
<p>Something else I learned about Québécois grains: a few decades ago, nobody believed that quality bread wheat could be grown in Québec. The hot, dry summers of Western Canada produced hard spring wheat, which yielded the ideal flour for bread.</p>
<div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden>

</div>
<p>Just before the turn of the millennium, the move towards artisan bread was starting to take hold in Québec. Bakers from France arrived in droves, and had an excruciatingly hard time producing French breads locally with the strong flours (~14% protein) milled from hard spring wheat. A growing demand thus emerged for a type of wheat that didn&rsquo;t interest the Western Canadian farmers.</p>
<p>La Milanaise, which started out as a mixed farming business in <a href=https://lamilanaise.com/en/history/>the 1970s</a> in the village of Milan in the Estrie region, rose up to the challenge of filling that void. With strong government support, La Milanaise pioneered the organic grain industry in Québec and nurtured the province&rsquo;s wheat culture. Québec now dominates organic farming growth in Canada, and produces winter wheat with far more complex aromas than spring wheat.</p>
<p>La Milanaise has become a leading <em>processor</em> of organic grains in Canada, exporting grain products to the US, Europe and Latin America. It sources >=60% of its grain from Québec farmers, and only purchases out West what cannot be grown locally. (Obviously, agriculture is heavily subsidized and protected by <em>le gouvernement du Québec</em>.) It&rsquo;s hard to tell which La Milanaise grains are grown in Québec and which are from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Additionally, La Milanaise has joined hands with Québécois bakery chain Première Moisson to found another mill, <a href=https://moulinsdesoulanges.com/language/en/home/>Les Moulins de Soulanges</a>, to develop specialty flours tailor-made to the needs of Québécois artisan bakers. Flours from La Milanaise are featured in Daniel Leader&rsquo;s <em>Local Breads</em>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not as keen on pre-milled flours as whole grains. But I did stop by Première Moisson (majority-owned by supermarket chain Metro since 2014) on Boulevard Lebourgneuf and got a WW buckwheat bread with Charlevoix hemp seeds. It was delicious and I felt fuckin' Canadian.</p>

<p>I did the usual 24-hour cold ferment.</p>
<p>The whole wheat flour milled from La Milanaise wheat berries is very soft, but not as <em>rouge</em> as Turkey Red.</p>

<p>The bread is very aromatic during and after baking. The crust smells like caramel, chocolate and roasted nuts. The crumb is light, open and soft.</p>
<figure><img loading=lazy src=/img/arctic-maplemoon/202201091338.jpg alt="Arctic Maplemoon">

<p>It tastes sweet and creamy, with some toasty wheatiness.</p>

<p>Madame Benoît, a 20th-century Québécois food writer, once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A recipe is only a theme, which an intelligent cook can play each time with a variation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree with her.</p>

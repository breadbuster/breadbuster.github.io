<p><em>This is part 4 of my <a href=/tags/california-grain-adventure/>California Grain Adventure</a>.</em></p>
<p>Every time I fly west, following the sun, I experience a lightening of spirit as the land below opens up, the checkerboards of the Midwestern plains giving way to the vast empty reach between the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I were to pick the time when I should travel in California, it would be in the early summer. All the rest of the world at that moment is green. California alone is sheer gold. &mldr; On one side the Pacific &ndash; tigerish, calm, powerfully palpitant, stretching into eternity in enormous bronze-gold, foam-laced planes. On the other side, great, bare, voluptuously-contoured hills, running parallel with the train and winding serpentinely on for hours and hours of express speed; hills that look, not as though they were covered with yellow grass, but as though they were carved from massy gold. At intervals come ravines filled with a heavy green growth. Occasionally on those golden hill-surfaces appear trees.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inez Haynes Irwin, <em>The Californiacs</em> (1919)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>My favorite road in California lies between Interstate 5 and Monterrey. I used to drive along <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_152>Route 152</a>, on the way from San Francisco to southern California, a dozen times a year. The land lies smoothly in carpets of green during the summer, then golds and browns for the rest of the year. Commanding it all are the oak trees spotting the hills. Today this part is still mostly clear of development and hasn&rsquo;t been overrun by greed or ambition.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually kind of odd, now that I think about it. I was initially drawn to California because of its Silicon Valley &ndash; I went to work in tech, and realized the tech scene there was a shadow of its former dotcom self; the real innovation was in finding new ways to scam investors and keeping the ball rolling. California&rsquo;s natural beauty was just one of accidental perks<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> that I discovered along the way.</p>
<p>I remember going to a California Impressionist art collection a few years ago in Irvine, a master-planned city in Orange County, southern California. The Irvine Museum was located in a peculiar place &ndash; on the bottom floor of a high-rise office building in Irvine&rsquo;s Financial District, a short walk from UC-Irvine campus and John Wayne Airport. The office building housed the usual white-collar businesses like law firms and travel agencies; the space occupied by the &ldquo;museum&rdquo; had a mundane corporate feel, and could just as easily house a dozen cubicles filled with telemarketers cold-calling people on adjustable-rate mortgages. It was actually more of a gallery &ndash; and not a very big one at that.</p>
<p>I later found out the building was originally a McDonnell Douglas Building and the museum, which used to be on the 12th floor, was <a href=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-04-15-ca-248-story.html>established</a> by descendants of James Irvine who founded Irvine Ranch, the sprawling agricultural property that evolved into the City of Irvine. The Irvine family developed their ranch in the 1960s, which is to say, the city didn&rsquo;t exist before then.</p>

<p>James Irvine was a canny, Belfast-born opportunist who came to California seeking gold. He failed to strike it rich in the streams and hills near Sutter&rsquo;s Mill, but became wealthy selling supplies to his fellow 49ers. (What&rsquo;s the saying? &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dig for gold, sell shovels!") In 1864, Irvine and three other San Francisco businessmen &ndash; Benjamin and Thomas Flint, and Llewellyn Bixby &ndash; bought 50,000 acres of <em>Rancho San Joaquín</em> from José Andrés Sepúlveda, a famed <em>Californio vaquero</em> who obtained the land in 1842 through a Mexican land grant and got into a dire debt crisis due to the Great Drought of the mid-1860s. (<em>Rancho San Joaquín</em> included the wind-blown marshlands on the ocean that has been developed into Newport Beach, one of California&rsquo;s most elite and picturesque boating and vacation spots.)</p>
<p>The Flints and Bixby were shrewd Yankee traders (of Maine colonial stock) with a taste for adventure and wealth. They came west during the Gold Rush of 1849, returned to the east, and came back again in 1853 on two wagons driving flocks of sheep, oxen, horses, and cows. This laid the economic foundation for fortunes of Irvine, Bixby and the Flints. A few years later, the trio acquired adjacent <em>El Rancho Lomas de Santiago</em> (the Ranch of the Hills of St. James) and <em>Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana</em>.</p>
<p>In 1876, James Irvine bought out his partners for $150,000. His 110,000 acres lay on the eastern bank of the Santa Ana River, stretching 23 miles from the Santa Ana Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. He held the land intact against droughts, squatters and lawsuits by railroads. When he died in 1886, the romantic ranch land was passed on to his son, James Irvine II, who incorporated it into the Irvine Company. James Irvine II also added olive, orange, lemon and walnut trees to the prosperous sheep and cattle grazing business. 10 years before he died in 1947, he set up the James Irvine Foundation to hold 51% of the Irvine Company stock, primarily as a tax maneuver. The Irvine Company was a vestige of the sort of personal tycoonnery that made mulit-millionaires out of immigrants in the Gold Rush days.</p>

<p>Joan Irvine Smith, the only child of James Irvine III and the great-granddaughter of the OG James Irvine, was a smart heiress. In 1957, at age 24, she replaced her mother as the major shareholder on the all-male board of the Irvine Company and the Irvine Foundation, with which she had a complicated relationship. She had seen, a good deal more clearly and realistically than what Jane Hollister Wheelwright, another descendant of one of California&rsquo;s oldest ranching families, would see 4 years later: the future of the ranch, which covered 1/5 of Orange County, must not be agrarian if it were to remain under her family&rsquo;s control. The rest of the Irvine board was a problem: By making small deals, selling off bits of the whole and keeping the holdings agrarian, the board was nibbling away at the family&rsquo;s bread and butter. So she pressed the architect William Pereira to present a master plan. She saw the potential return in donating the land for a University of California campus, and pushed for using Irvine Company lands (a pastoral island surrounded by bustling suburbia, a freeway hop from Los Angeles) for urban development. Most importantly, she insisted on maintaining an interest in the ranch&rsquo;s development. In the end, which is to say after years of internecine battles and a series of lawsuits extending three decades, she more or less prevailed.</p>
<p>In 1960, before the Irvine Ranch was developed, there were 719,500 people in the whole Orange County. In 2000, there were close to 3 million, most of whom would not have been there if two families &ndash; the Irvines in central Orange County, and the inheritors of Richard O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s <em>Rancho Santa Margarita</em> and <em>Mission Viejo</em> acreage in the southern &ndash; had not developed their ranches.</p>

<hr>
<p>The California Club, which is on Flower Street in downtown Los Angeles, is still the heart of southern California&rsquo;s old-money business establishment, the LA version of the Bohemian Club and Pacific Union Club in San Francisco. On any given day since World War II, virtually everyone lunching at the California Club has had a direct or indirect investment in the development of California, which is to say in the obliteration of the undeveloped California on exhibition at the Irvine Museum: rolling hills and rugged seascapes; desert and mesas and arroyos; frothy waves, mountains, and big blue sky; eucalyptus, sycamore, oak, and cottonwood; cockatoos, peacocks, and horses.</p>
<p>California Impressionism, of course, is a stepchild of French Impressionism, adapted with varying success to a new set of atmospheric conditions and mingled (or mangled) with various other styles. Southern Californian artists basked in broad viewer approval; they painted entirely to celebrate a golden land, sharing an Arcadian vision with fellow Californians &ndash; and with tourists smitten by the fantasy of sun, surf, golden hills and distant snow-capped mountains.</p>
<p>What struck me the most, while viewing the Irvine collection, was that it was permeated with a tenacious (or even pernicious) mood of nostalgia for the good old days, when California&rsquo;s landscape was unspoiled, and yet it evidently lacked human passions. Whatever human forms you manage to make out are dwarfed by the undeveloped landscape, and some even look like indistinct Indians.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is more nostalgia for me in these paintings than in actually going out to look at what used to be the ranch now that it has been developed, because I’m looking at what I looked at as a child.</p>
<ul>
<li>Joan Irvine Smith</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of this wilderness was romantic, some washed with a slightly falsified golden light, in the tradition that runs from Albert Bierstadt&rsquo;s &ldquo;lustrous pearly mist&rdquo; to Thomas Kinkade&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;glow.&rdquo; Most of these paintings, however, reflect the way California looked to anyone who knew the place before the 1960s.</p>
<p>This close representation of a familiar yet vanished landscape gives the Irvine collection its amusing effect, that of a short-term memory misfire: These paintings hang in a newly built city, Irvine (population >300,000, with a University of California campus enrolling some 36,000 students), that was some 60 years ago a mirror image of the paintings themselves &ndash; bean fields and grazing &ndash; but by no means all of the cattle and sheep operations amassed by the great-grandfather of the founder of the Irvine Museum.</p>

<p>Orange County&rsquo;s middle-class promise didn&rsquo;t pan out for all who came, but the population boom did wonders to the bottom line of the Irvine Company.</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s commercial portfolio grew and grew with new development and upgrades. The Irvine Company-owned land in Orange County has become the country&rsquo;s best-selling spot for new homes, the high-end market in particular drawing continued interest from homebuilders year on year. (Orange County is one of the most expensive counties to live in the US, with a <a href=https://www.redfin.com/county/332/CA/Orange-County/housing-market>median home price of $940K</a> in January 2023; its residents include founders of Kingston, Broadcom, and Pimco.) In Orange County, the company owns large parts of the 5,000-acre Irvine Spectrum Center, Fashion Island, Newport Center, half of Irvine&rsquo;s 185-acre University Research Park, Jamboree Center, MacArthur Court and the Resort at Pelican Hill.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Newport Beach, home to some of the richest neighborhoods in the country, the privately held Irvine Company is the largest owner of offices in California and one of the two largest apartments owners in the state. Along with Orange County, San Diego and Silicon Valley, the Irvine Company has sizable holdings in Los Angeles and owns three trophy skyscrapers in Chicago. It also owns the MetLife Building at 200 Park Ave in Manhattan. The company&rsquo;s holdings total ~120 million sqft, including more than 500 offices buildings and 40 retail centers, plus ~160 apartment communities with nearly 60,000 units, two golf clubs, five marinas, and three resorts.</p>
<p>Donald Bren, the current chairman and sole shareholder of the Irvine Company, is the wealthiest person in Orange County with a net worth of ~$17 billion, ranking No.1 among US real estate executives and No.112 on the 2022 Forbes Billionaires List.</p>
<p>Bren got his start as a homebuilder in 1958. In 1977, he joined a group of investors to acquire control of the Irvine Company. In 1983, he bought out many of his partners for $518 million and became the majority owner of the Irvine Company. In 1991, he paid <a href=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-06-19-mn-986-story.html>$256 million</a> to heiresses Joan Irvine Smith and her mother, Athalie R. Clarke, for their shares. In 1996, he became sole owner of the Irvine Company.</p>
<p>It was with these proceeds of looking exclusively, and to a famous degree, forward that Joan Irvine Smith built her collection of <em>plein air</em> art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can look at these paintings and look back. I can see California as it was and as we will never see it again,&rdquo; she told <em>Art in California</em>. Hers is an extreme example of the conundrum that to one degree or another confronts any Californian who profited from the boom years: If we could still see California as it was, how many of us could now afford to &ldquo;see&rdquo; it?</p>

<h3 id=pan-de-sonora><em>Pan de Sonora</em><a href=#pan-de-sonora class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>In the spirit of Joan Irvine Smith, why don&rsquo;t we look forward by forgetting what the Sonora Blanca wheat was traditionally used for and starting to explore its potential in new applications?</p>
<p>As <a href=/posts/california-dreamin-3>mentioned</a>, a lot of bakers shun Sonora in breadmaking by default because of its commercial classification as a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; wheat. As a result, Sonora&rsquo;s potential has been limited to tortillas, biscuits, pastries, cookies, and cakes &ndash; the flat, dense stuff.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, my preferred application for Sonora is in sourdough breads.</p>
<p>Making <a href=/posts/desert-dynamo>a lofty loaf of bread</a> out of 100% Sonora is possible, but requires a little tango:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diastatic malt increases the conversion of starches to sugar, boosting the Maillard reaction of the crust. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C)&mldr;tightens the gluten network and gives the bread a better rise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resulting bread will turn out just as airy and lofty as the breads made from hard wheat &ndash; and taste far more flavorful.</p>
<p>Additionally, making bread with weak wheat inspires you to think and be creative, instead of just autopiloting &ndash; or staying in your comfort zone where your unrealized dream is buried.</p>
<p>Baking a good loaf of bread is about knowing <a href=/about>who you are</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>For this loaf:</p>
<ul>
<li>total Sonora Blanca milled: 400g (100%)</li>
<li>total dough hydration: 538g (135%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Just for fun, I hand-bolted the 400g wholegrain Sonora flour into 80% (320g) flour and 20% (80g) coarse bran & midds. (Midds are less coarse bits of bran and germ, plus not-so-fine flour particles).</p>
<p>I applied 60g of the bran & midds to the levain and the remaining 20g to a porridge.</p>

<p>Wheat midds actually contain higher levels of fiber, protein and minerals than the parent grain and have less starch and calorie. However, they are usually considered an &ldquo;unwanted&rdquo; by-product of the wheat flour milling industry and used as animal feed. Since I&rsquo;m milling my own grains, I get to keep and enjoy all of it.</p>

<p>Process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Toast the dry bran mix in a 300F oven (or in a skillet on the stovetop) for 3-4 minutes, until a slight toasty aroma hits your nose. This step is optional but will enhance the flavor enormously. Just be careful not to go overboard &ndash; it will burn in a flash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put the bran mix in a small pot and pour in milk; bring to a full boil, whisking frequently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce heat and simmer until a thick, creamy consistency. Turn off heat and let it cool off.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The bran mix cooks fast &ndash; the whole thing takes 10-15 minutes tops.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can make this in a microwave, too, just make sure to pause and stir frequently.</li>
<li>Any kind of milk will work.</li>
</ul>
<p>This porridge is so freakin' good that you may not be able to resist eating it right out of the pot! Feel free to whip up a big pot of bran porridge either in the evening or on a quiet morning, and keep it in the fridge for a whole week of easy, nutritious breakfasts (topped with fruits, nuts, and a drizzle of honey).</p>
<h4 id=anise-orange-water>Anise orange water<a href=#anise-orange-water class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Why use orange peels, instead of fresh orange juice, like in my <a href=/posts/desert-dynamo>last Sonora loaf</a>? Well, a few reasons: I want to try something new; I have a ton of dried and frozen orange peels on hand; orange peels are flavorful, aromatic, and loaded with nutrients (wonderful additions to tea); orange peels actually contain almost twice as much vitamin C (and flavonoids) than the flesh of the fruit or the juice. In general, oranges with thicker peels tend to have more vitamin C, as the nutrient is concentrated in the peel and the white pith underneath.</p>
<p>Making the anise orange water is really simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Boil a handful of orange peels (fresh or dried) and a pinch of aniseeds in a pot of water for 5-10 minutes. Optional: add a stick of cinnamon and/or a few cardamom seeds and cloves for extra flavor.</li>
<li>Turn off heat and let cool off.</li>
<li>Strain with a fine-mesh sieve.</li>
<li>Stir in honey or sweetener of choice.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mine turned out a light amber-colored, aromatic, slightly sweetish tea.</p>
<p>You can also use lemon peels instead of oranges. Other substitutes include grapefruit, lime, tangerine, clementine, or citrons. You can use any fruit or vegetable that has high quantity of vitamin C. If all fails, use a tablespoon of lemon juice or rosewater.</p>

<p>Dough process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Autolyse @ ~70% hydration</em>: Mix the flour with malt; stir in 1/2 of the anise orange water; mix until a shaggy mass; let autolyze for 30 minutes in the fridge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Levain</em>: Squeeze in the levain; mix until combined. Let rest for 10-20 minutes at room temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Double hydration</em>: Add 90% of the remaining anise orange water gradually, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgz0oAhgwyg">Rubaud-mixing</a> (lifting, stretching, and dropping) until thoroughly absorbed. This requires a bit patience, so take your time. If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;m good at, it&rsquo;s <em>bassinage</em>. And I usually put on some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlQWGGham__4sBxnwVyKbM8n91Xb9vwUG">music</a> or <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkB8eF4ATHl4Jm1BeCZgQ9A>podcasts</a> while I do this. Hand-mixing a dough is a type of alternative physical therapy; I find it tremendously therapeutic and cathartic. Gorging the dough with soooo much water feels like a crime, TBH. I keep going until the dough tells me to stop&mldr;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Salt</em>: Mix in the salt. The dough is quite sticky. Let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bran porridge</em>: Divide the bran porridge into 3-4 portions; spread over the dough one portion at a time; mix until evenly distributed. Let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Triple hydration</em>: Add the rest of the anise orange water, Rubaud-mixing until completely incorporated. Let rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Olive oil</em>: Drizzle in the olive oil, Rubaud-mixing until entirely combined.</p>
</li>

<p>Transfer the dough to a fridge (or somewhere 38F-43F) right away and ferment for 24 hours; take it out a every few hours and perform a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JQm2n4aVZc">coil-fold</a>. I did 4 folds in total.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 24 hours of bulk fermentation, shape the dough into whatever form you want. Let it warm up to room temperature for 2-3 hours before sending it into <em>el horno</em>.</p>

<hr>
<p>This Sonora dough went so far beyond my usual <em>pan de cristal</em> hydration level &ndash; and it&rsquo;s supposedly a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; wheat!!!</p>
<p>White whole wheat is always magical: the bran, germ, and midds become &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; after baking, and you can&rsquo;t tell it&rsquo;s whole wheat.</p>
<p>Once again, Sonora did not disappoint.</p>

<p>A custardy crumb flecked with airy holes is enrobed in dramatically thin, crispy crusts.</p>
<p>My <a href=/posts/california-dreamin-2>134% hydration <em>pan de San Joaquín</em></a> had creamy-as-pudding center, but &ndash; holy grain &ndash; that peculiar creaminess was even more pronounced in this Sonora version!</p>
<p>Usually, whole grains (especially with weak gluten) turn bread into a dense brick, but this version is miraculous, with generous <em>alveoli</em>.</p>

<p>A full-flavored wholegrain bread without the typical aesthetics of a wholegrain bread. The toasted bran porridge adds a ton of custardiness and flavor to the crumb.</p>
<p>Definitely not what you would typically expect from a bread made from a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; wheat.</p>
<p>The bread&rsquo;s most pronounced characteristic was a subtle buttery, sweet flavor that lingered in my mouth. I think I tasted the Sonoran Desert &ndash; the soil, the texture, the flavor.</p>

<p>The porous, chewy texture reminded me of a <em>pan corriente</em> (&ldquo;ordinary bread&rdquo;) that I once had with hot chocolate in Morelia, Mexico.</p>
<p>I secretly think that labeling Sonora as a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; wheat does it tremendous injustice.</p>
<p>I cut this bread into thick slices, and seared them so that they were crisp on one side and as creamy as pudding within. I was planning to serve them to guests topped with different compositions &ndash; crème fraîche, smoked anchovy and arugula, sour cherry jam &ndash; but I was so drawn by the texture that most of the pieces I cooked didn&rsquo;t make it out of the kitchen.</p>

</figure>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if Sonora is a forlorn or undiscovered bread wheat, but this wheat has lofty potentials.</p>
<p>I can see the Sonora flour fulfilling many purposes in cooking and baking because of its unique makeup: It&rsquo;s a beautiful &ldquo;soft&rdquo; heritage wheat with a naturally ivory color, and a subtle, creamy wheat flavor that&rsquo;s almost neutral. A must-try for anyone who prizes the nuances of taste, texture, and performance found only in heritage grains.</p>
<p><code>Hot take</code>: Using Sonora in cookies, cakes, and pastries severely caps its baking potential. It&rsquo;s a waste. FFS, use Frederick (SWWW, 7.5%-9% protein) in such things. Spare Sonora &ndash; it can do so much better.</p>

<p>Another perk: I learned that a very important but often overlooked reason why California, instead of an East Coast city, became the tech mecca, is because in the eastern states, intellectual property created by an employee belongs to the employer, whereas in California it has historically belonged to the employee. Therefore, in software, an employee could come up with an innovative idea, take investment, and become a CEO. This attracted VCs and talented, ambitious engineers. Without this distinction, Silicon Valley &ndash; if there was going to be one &ndash; would likely have developed around MIT.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Lithuania has a best-kept secret: <em><strong>keptinis alus</strong></em>, an exotic farmhouse raw ale made with &ldquo;baked&rdquo; mash.</p>
<p>This beer style &ndash; like a softer, rounder porter but with stronger, deeper caramel and toffee flavors &ndash; dates back to the Viking era. Nowadays it&rsquo;s made by only a few farmhouse brewers in northeastern Lithuania and 3 commercial breweries: <a href=https://dundulis.lt/en/>Dundulis</a>, <a href=https://www.ratebeer.com/brewers/ramuno-cizo-alaus-darykla/10373/>Ramunas Čižas</a>, <a href=https://www.ratebeer.com/brewers/kupiskio-alus/12065/>Kupiškio Alus</a> (<em>kupiškėnų keptinis</em> was once voted the best Lithuanian beer on RateBeer.com).</p>

</div>
<p>The brewing process, which has been passed down orally from generation to generation over the centuries, usually begins with a conventional, but thick, mash for an hour. Meanwhile, the brewer heats an oven to incredibly high temperatures &ndash; likely >700˚F (371˚C). Then the brewer packs the mash into tins that look like bread pans and bake them in the oven. Just before the loaves go in, the brewer removes the fuel from the oven, so that it cools over the course of a few hours. While in the oven, the mash forms a centimeter-thick, deep-brown crust, and goes through Maillard reactions in addition to caramelization. Beneath that crust, the firm mash becomes, in <a href=https://www.garshol.priv.no/blog/394.html>Lars Garshol</a>&rsquo;s words,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;sweet, toasted, and caramelly sugary, with earthy, honey-like notes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine sweet mash cookies&mldr;</p>
<p>The brewer breaks up the charred mash and creates a second mash, adding hop tea (it&rsquo;s a raw ale, after all) before fermenting. The boatload of toasted sugars imparts massive toasty toffee flavors. I can only imagine the depth of flavors in an old-fashioned <em>keptinis</em>, as well as its robust notes of caramel and toffee that probably linger for a long time.</p>
<p>Lars Garshol also mentioned that Martin Warren of the Poppyland Brewery in Norfolk, England <a href=https://poppylandbrewer.blogspot.com/2015/04/a-great-way-to-lose-day.html>tried to brew a <em>keptinis</em></a> and failed miserably. Here&rsquo;s what Warren did:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dry malt bill was mixed in a large bucket until even. Then 1.5kg at a time were put into a large mixing bowl and about 1.4 litres of near boiling water added, enough to wet all the grains and make a stiff mix.</p>
<p>This was quickly put into a shallow baking tray to form a flat &lsquo;loaf&rsquo; and turned out onto a newspaper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing the reasons he wound up with black, unfermentable water with no sugar in it are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the mash was too dry;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the mashing process didn&rsquo;t last long enough to activate the enzymes that convert starches into fermentable sugars; all the enzymes in the malt were destroyed via baking before any conversion took place.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;d end up with a sugarless water this way.</p>
<figure><img loading=lazy src=/img/byb-2/keptinis-baked-mash.jpg alt="traditional keptinis baked mash"><figcaption class=right><p>Lithuanian traditional baked mash, at <em>Dundulio Koštuvė</em> 2022</p><p>Source: <a href=https://www.facebook.com/dundulis.alus.gira/posts/pfbid0291AL9yjwHsfeshtTdo48c6irt12VozD6YkCyvDh7o7ZigUgcSoiL5dqpPUKkmj52l target=_blank rel=noreferrer>Dundulis</a></p>

</figure>
<p>When Lithuanians brew <em>keptinis</em>, they mix the grist and water into a thick porridge-like consistency, and leave it for an hour to convert. After that, they scoop the mash out and caramelize it in the oven.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technically, caramelization is the thermal degradation of sugars which leads to the formation of both volatiles (caramel aroma) and brown-colored products (caramel colors). It is similar to Maillard reactions in that it is a non-enzymatic browning reaction, but caramelization occurs by pyrolysis (thermochemical degradation in the absence of oxygen) instead of by chemical reaction. Caramelization is catalyzed by an acid or a base, and generally requires temperatures above 120°C and a pH between 3 and 9.</p>
<ul>
<li>John Mallett, <em>Malt: A Practical Guide from Field to Brewhouse</em> (the Brewing Elements series)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Baking 30% of the mash probably doesn&rsquo;t give enough flavor to <em>keptinis</em>. A few years ago, Lithuanian brewery Dundulis made a new effort to <a href=https://dundulis.lt/en/keptinis-baked-ale/>reconstruct traditional <em>keptinis</em></a> that had ~55% of the mash baked, which gave more of the right <em>keptinis</em> flavor.</p>

<p>Curiously, I remember reading about an Iberian beer called <em>caelia</em> brewed during Roman times with wheat germ that was also formed into loaves and baked. Some sources suggest the bread was heated at very low temperatures and removed while it was still wet; essentially the brewers were creating a yeast bomb to inoculate fermentable grains.</p>
<p>During an episode of Milk the Funk podcast, Lars Garshol made the point that historically a large metal kettle for brewing would have been prohibitively expensive for most people, so either adding hot stones to a mash vessel or baking the entire mash was a more affordable option. (This is probably true for most of Europe, at least at one point in time.)</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s my translation of <em>keptinis</em> into a loaf of bread.</p>
<h3 id=saccharified-scald>Saccharified scald<a href=#saccharified-scald class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Malt is <a href=https://exarc.net/issue-2021-2/at/ancient-magic-malt-making>ancient magic</a>.</p>
<p>Yeast can&rsquo;t live on sugar alone. It also needs nutrients like nitrogen, amino acids, minerals (Zn, Mg, Ca), and vitamins to thrive and grow. The primary source for these building blocks is the free amino nitrogen (FAN) and lipids from malted barley. Refined sugars don&rsquo;t contain any of these nutrients.</p>
<p>Wort is the liquid extracted from the mashing process during the brewing of beer or whisky. Wort contains the sugars (especially maltose and maltotriose) that will be fermented by the brewing yeast to produce alcohol. An all-malt wort contains all the nutrients yeast needs for fermentation, except oxygen and zinc.</p>
<p>Lab studies have shown that rye malt worts contain less maltose and more nitrogen than barley malt worts. Further, rye malts tend to be richer than barley malts in alpha amylase, although barley malts provide slightly higher diastatic power. Including rye also increases the wort&rsquo;s pH.</p>
<p>Total dry malts: 300g</p>

<p><a href=https://www.rootshootmalting.com><strong>Root Shoot Malting</strong></a> is a craft malthouse located in Loveland, Colorado &ndash; the first in the US to operate on a Kaspar Schulz malting system. They won a gold medal for Genie Pale in 2019, a bronze for Munich 10 in 2020, and a bronze for Genie Pale in 2021.</p>

<p>I incorporated some high-quality, locally-sourced malts from Root Shoot Malting to add aromas and flavors in the bread:</p>

<p>The rare heritage <strong><a href=/img/byb-2/RootShoot-Oland-wheat-malt.png><em>Ölandsvete</em> wheat malt</a></strong> adds light caramel and roasty flavors, as well as full-bodied character.</p>
<p><em>Ölandsvete</em> (or <em>Ølandsvete</em>) is an ancient variety of wheat first grown over 6,000 years ago on the second-largest Swedish island <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96land>Öland</a>, just off of Sweden&rsquo;s east coast in the Baltic Sea. <em>Ölandsvete</em> is a low-yield, high-protein (14%-16%) spring wheat that was once common all across Europe and northern Africa. Like many other heritage varieties, <em>Ölandsvete</em> nearly disappeared &ndash; until a few Swedish farmers started bringing it back in the late 1990s and local bakers started using it in traditional sourdough recipes. The Danish celeb chef Claus Meyer, for example, made a highly popular <a href=https://meyers.dk/opskrifter/the-oland-wheat-bread/p/75089/>Öland bread</a>. Today, there are only a few farmers in the world who grow the <em>Ölandsvete</em> variety. One of them is Olander Farms in Loveland, Colorado, the <em>château</em> of Root Shoot Malting, which is quite possibly the only malthouse in the country to malt this variety. The Family Jones Distillery in Denver, Colorado uses this heritage wheat for its unique single-estate <a href=https://thefamilyjones.co/#premium-spirits-section>Annika Jones Vodka</a>.</p>
<figure><img loading=lazy src=/img/byb-2/20230403_221256.jpg alt="Ölandsvete wheat malt"><figcaption class=right><p>Rare heritage <em>Ölandsvete</em> wheat malt, crafted by Root Shoot Malting.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Unmilled <em>Ölandsvete</em> malt from Root Shoot smells sweet and nutty, with a hint of honeydew melon. Upon milling, that aroma becomes more pronounced. The fact that this variety came from Scandinavia, grown by farmers with Scandinavian ancestry, for a US baker making a Nordic-Baltic-style bread &ndash; is quite interesting all around.</p>
<figure><img loading=lazy src=/img/byb-2/20230403_221323.jpg alt="Bono winter rye malt"><figcaption class=right><p>Bono winter rye malt, crafted by Root Shoot Malting.</p>

<p>The <a href=/img/byb-2/RootShoot-rye-malt.png><strong>Bono winter rye malt</strong></a> contributes some earthy and nutty sunflower seed flavors as well as spiced notes.</p>
<figure><img loading=lazy src=/img/byb-2/20230403_221244.jpg alt="honey malt"><figcaption class=right><p>Honey malt, from Genie (a 2-row spring barley), crafted by Root Shoot Malting.</p>

</figure>
<p>The <a href=/img/byb-2/RootShoot-honey-malt.png><strong>honey malt</strong></a>, from Genie (a 2-row spring barley), lends a pretzel aroma and some tropical tart sweetness. This malt is produced through a very distinct malting process, which makes it closely resemble a melanoidin malt.</p>
<p>The honey malt, especially when freshly milled, has an absolutely intoxicating aroma and flavor. I don&rsquo;t smell or taste grapefruit, but I do notice complex sweet tartness of mango, guava, passion fruit, soursop, and lychee; honeyed, tangy, tropical, and terrifically punchy citrus. It leaves an exclamation mark at the tip of my nose &ndash; and reminds me of Java, Indonesia in March/April, when an abundance of tropical fruits are in season. I almost suggested to Root Shoot that they should rename the malt &ldquo;Tropical Fruit Punch.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a real unique malt that I&rsquo;m definitely going to use a lot more of in my breads.</p>
<p><strong>Process</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Grind the malts, individually or collectively, into a flour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place all the malts in a bowl or small saucepan; add hot water in 2-3 increments, stirring constantly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the scald at ~125°F for 2 hours; then raise the temperature to ~150°F and hold for another 6 hours.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon initial mixing, the scald had a sweet roasty aroma and a sweet taste.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After saccharification, the sweet roasty aroma and taste went through the roof. Most people don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to see or to experience this magical process. I&rsquo;m extremely fortunate.</p>
<figure><img loading=lazy src=/img/byb-2/20230405_015628.jpg alt="scald after saccharification"><figcaption class=right><p>scald after saccharification</p>

</figure>
<p>Saccharification is an essential part of the brewing process. A few hundred years ago, making malt and brewing beer at home was a common activity. It happened on farms and in large households. It was a household task.</p>
<p>Today it seems to be a mystery to many.</p>
<h3 id=caramelized-scald>Caramelized scald<a href=#caramelized-scald class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>The trick with <em>keptinis</em> is to properly caramelize the mash in the oven. You want a crust that is charred. Lithuanians typically bake the mash in a deep, wood-fired <em>dúonkepis</em> oven (>700˚F) to achieve <a href=https://www.curiouscook.com/site/2012/09/caramelization-new-science-new-possibilities.html>caramelization</a>.</p>
<p>After 6 hours of saccharification, I scooped <strong>400g</strong> (two-thirds) of the sweet scald onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and let the remaining 200g (one-third) continue saccharifying for another 2 hours.</p>
<p>Remember I mentioned earlier that Dundulis' recent revival of <em>keptinis</em> had ~55% of the mash baked to produce more of the right flavor? 2/3 (or ~67%) seemed about right to me, at least for starters.</p>
<p>I spread it out into a thin layer, to optimize the crust area for caramelization. Then I baked it in a 350°F oven for 20 minutes until it started to look dark brown in spots and smell toasty (and even slightly burnt).</p>
<figure><img loading=lazy src=/img/byb-2/20230404_225328.jpg alt="oven-caramelized scald"><figcaption class=right><p>oven-caramelized sweet scald crackers</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The process of caramelization creates one of the most naturally delectable and complex combinations of sweet, savory, and bitter flavors there is.</p>
<p>As the water evaporates, the sugar concentration and the temperature of the sugar molecules continue to increase. The (now pure) molten sugar will rise above 212°F/100°C (the boiling point) and will go through its <a href=https://www.joyofbaking.com/StagesOfCookedSugar.html>different cooking stages</a>. Gradually, the sugar molecules begin to break down and new compounds form (including caramel); the thermal decomposition accelerates significantly as the sugar reaches a temperature of 320°F (160°C).</p>
<p>IMO, it&rsquo;s best to get a wide range of caramel colors, from the alluring darkest shades (with smokey bitter notes) to the lightest hues.</p>
<p>The key to caramelization is the combination of cooking temperature and cooking time. I find it absolutely fascinating that sugar can actually <a href=https://www.seriouseats.com/dry-toasted-sugar-granulated-caramel-recipe>caramelize at temperatures below its melting point</a>. I speculate this scald might have a different flavor if it&rsquo;s caramelized low and slow, e.g. baked in the gentler heat of a 300°F (149°C) oven for a few hours, or <a href=https://www.curiouscook.com/site/2012/09/caramelization-new-science-new-possibilities.html>at 250°F (125°C) overnight and longer</a>.</p>
<p>Caramelization will reduce fermentability, because caramelizing also binds simple sugars into more complex ones &ndash; possibly too complex for the yeast to digest. Generally, yeast can digest only mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides. Anything more complex than that will remain in solution, adding some residual sweetness but not much (think <em><a href=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-make-medieval-mead-bochet>bochets</a></em>, a type of Medieval mead made from caramelized honey).</p>
<p>In reality, most of the colors and flavors of &ldquo;caramelization&rdquo; are actually due to Maillard reactions where the sugars interact with amino acids to make large and complex molecules. The amount of browning can be a good clue to how much of the sugars have bonded to create large molecules. The more brown the caramelized sugar, the less fermentable it will be. Some simple sugars are indeed created in the process, but the end result is larger flavor and aroma molecules, which are formed from the initial sugars present.</p>
<p>Caramelization doesn&rsquo;t caramelize all sugar molecules, so some sugars will still remain fermentable. A number of Belgian beers use <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candi_sugar>candi sugar</a>, a type of caramelized beet sugar, to add flavors, colors, as well as gravity points.</p>
<p>The caramelized scald turned out like a Nordic crispbread, but very sticky &ndash; there was a layer of sticky syrupy substance underneath the parchment paper!</p>
<figure><img loading=lazy src=/img/byb-2/20230404_233038.jpg alt="oven-caramelized scald"><figcaption class=right><p>oven-caramelized scald crackers: net weight 149.5g</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once the caramelized scald cooled off, I broke it up into smaller pieces. My 400g of liquidy scald yielded ~150g of dried concentrate.</p>
<p>Then I ground them up in a coffee grinder into a flour. The ground flour smelled very toasty and caramelized &ndash; like churro, cocoa, and bread crust.</p>
<figure><img loading=lazy src=/img/byb-2/20230404_235538.jpg alt="oven-caramelized scald ground"><figcaption class=right><p>oven-caramelized scald crackers, ground into a flour</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After the remaining 200g scald had gone through another 2 hours of saccharification, I stirred all of the caramelized scald flour (~150g) back into it.</p>
<p>The scald instantly transformed into something much more wonderful &ndash; a darker shade of chocolaty brown, with a seductive caramel aroma. After vigorous mixing, I let the newly-infused scald sit for another hour at ~150°F, so the flavors could meld.</p>
<p>The 600g scald I started with got reduced down to 350g, and became much more concentrated in aromas and flavors.</p>
<p>Total scald: 350g</p>
<h3 id=barm-opshaug-kveik-ale-yeast>Barm: Opshaug kveik ale yeast<a href=#barm-opshaug-kveik-ale-yeast class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>I decided to inoculate the scald with White Labs' <a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-single?id=157&type=YEAST&style_type=1">WLP518</a> Opshaug kveik, a clean-fermenting farmhouse ale yeast from Norway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this Kveik strain was isolated from a mixed culture which belonged to Harald Opshaug, a farmhouse brewer in Stranda, Norway. This strain was originally used in the 1990s to produce several kornøl-style beers. It is a clean fermenting yeast and has tolerated temperatures up to 95°F (35°C) while finishing fermentation within three to four days. The hop-forward, clean characteristics of this strain make it ideal for IPAs and pale ales.</p>

<p>This yeast is traditionally used for Norwegian <em>kornøl</em> (a farmhouse raw ale), and its low esters complement hops. Maybe it will complement the insanely malty character of the scald, too?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to get the most out of <a href=https://www.milkthefunk.com/wiki/Kveik>kveiks</a>, based on my research:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use an all-malt scald.</li>
<li>Saccharify the scald as much as possible (>=6 hours).</li>
<li>Use just a tiny bit of kveik (seriously underpitching).</li>
<li>Ferment aerobically; oxygenate often.</li>
<li>Ferment hot (~95°F).</li>
</ol>
<p>I transferred all of the scald into a clean, shallow, wide-mouthed bowl. I let it cool down to ~95°F. Then I added 1g (~40 drops) of WLP518 liquid yeast.</p>

<p>I covered the bowl loosely, and fermented it at <strong>90-95°F</strong> for <strong>7 hours</strong>. I gave it a stir every 30 minutes during the first 3 hours to aerate.</p>
<p>After 6 hours, the barm more than doubled in volume and became very bubbly.</p>

</figure>
<p>I stirred it back down, and it bubbled back up again within an hour. Indeed, the kveik ferments a lot faster than common ale yeasts.</p>

<p>The fermented barm had a faintly fruity and beery smell, and a slightly sweet but still very toasty flavor. Very sticky, also.</p>

<p>I mixed everything together into a shaggy mass (increase hydration as needed), and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to autolyze.</p>

<p>The bread turned out quintessentially brown like a dark caramel. Its dense, opaque, and mysterious appearance reminded me of a brown ale rather than a questionable hazy IPA.</p>
<p><strong>Aroma</strong></p>
<p>The bread had a very complex aroma: aggressively caramel upfront, followed by scents of chocolate, <a href=https://www.thespruceeats.com/english-toffee-520453>toffee</a>, molasses, and dark brown sugar; deeply malty and subtly wheaty. It reminded me of the sugary wafts of <a href=https://walkers-nonsuch.co.uk/about-walkers/our-history/>Walker&rsquo;s Nonsuch Toffee</a> in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, England.</p>
<p>The aroma was so sweet and rich that it immediately transported me into an old-time candy shop where I was surrounded by handmade caramels, dark chocolate, truffles, fudge, etc&mldr;</p>
<p>Notes of toasted bread crusts, graham crackers, orange, and cinnamon sat contently in the background.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Texture</strong></p>
<p>The texture was decidedly chewy, soft, moist, and sticky; the tenderness reminded me a lot of <a href=https://www.latimes.com/recipe/mantou-steamed-chinese-buns>Chinese steamed buns</a> (<em>mantou</em>). Both the texture and the flavor reminded me of <a href=https://thewoksoflife.com/nian-gao-recipe/>lunar new year sweet rice cake</a> (made with basic ingredients like brown sugar, water / coconut milk, and glutinous rice flour).</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>Flavor</strong></p>
<p>The flavor was complex with immediate competition of toffee, toasted bread, orange, cinnamon, walnut, and molasses. There was a hint of butteriness and wheatiness.</p>
<p>The flavor kept on developing: There was an explosion of caramel and chocolate flavors as the bread first hit the tongue, balanced by a faintly hoppy undertone. When combined with the subtle earthiness of the grains, the malty flavors became more pronounced. The mildly sweet and nutty flavors of wholegrain wheat and rye started to shine through and became more endearing.</p>
<p>As I was about to swallow, the flavors deepened even further &ndash; to rival the aggressively caramely and malty aroma I was smelling initially. Coupled with lingering hints of dates, raisins, plums, and chocolate, it made for a soul-satisfying taste.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After I swallowed, the caramely flavor mellowed out and gently transitioned to some bitter / hoppy notes. This was followed by a deluge of saliva &ndash; my mouth was begging for more of this flavor bomb.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall ever having a bread with such a long progression of flavors that slowly marched across my taste buds or teased my palate in such deliberate ways.</p>
<p>As the bread was toasted, the caramel flavor gave way to more burnt notes &ndash; not acrid but more like the deep caramelization on the surface of grilled fruits. With further toasting, walnut and molasses took over the flavor. The bread was sweet, although less sweet as it toasted, but it was not cloying.</p>
<p>This bread looked and tasted like it should be really sweet &ndash; on par with the tooth-aching intensity of marshmallows, angel food cake, and fudge &ndash; but it just isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s gently sweet with an enjoyable toffee flavor, <em>sans</em> toothaches.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>Mouthfeel</strong></p>
<p>The crust was thin and crisp. The crumb was juicy (i.e. an evocative sensation that brought back sensory memories of biting into a ripe plum or peach, but not a juicy apple or pear) and soft, not heavy at all like its appearance or flavor suggested. It reminded me of eating a bowl of toasted oatmeal.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p>I was &ndash; and still am &ndash; honestly blown away by how good this bread turned out.</p>
<p>The flavor was so deep and complex that it&rsquo;s crazy to think this bread was made from just some austere barley, rye, and wheat without any specialty ingredients.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of Baltic black breads, but this bread is radically different from any black bread I&rsquo;ve ever tasted. It aligns very well with how people describe <em>keptinis</em> from experienced brewers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hazy dark brown, thin, tan head. Aroma of brown bread, toast, chestnut, cashew, raisin, old banana. Taste has sweetish raisin & prune, sourish berries over brown-bready, almost wholemeal maltiness.</p>
<ul>
<li>an internet review of <em><a href=https://brewver.com/beers/23908/Kurko-Keptinis>kurko keptinis</a></em> from <em>Širvenos Bravoras</em> (Dundulis)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is definitely an interesting twist on the Baltic bread tradition. Baking the saccharified scald into caramelized sugars is intriguing &ndash; and kind of reminds me of <a href=https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/13369/altus-amp-formula>altus</a> and <a href=https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/55979/alt-altus>alt altus</a>.</p>
<p>The bread had no weird fermentation character or sourness at all. The WLP518 Opshaug kveik strain helped a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; grain flavor shine through &ndash; just like the grain-forward <a href=/tags/wlp001/>WLP001</a> California ale yeast did in my <a href=/posts/byb-1-2/>previous bread-plays</a> &ndash; underneath the complex caramely flavors. I have no doubt this bread will taste completely different if fermented with a sourdough levain instead of a kveik.</p>

<p>I malted a batch of heritage Chevallier barley at home (probably undermodified) and sun-dried them before grinding into a flour, to ensure the malt remained as pale as possible.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stranger, let me warn you now. If ever you start for California with the intention of seeing anything of the State, do that before you enter San Francisco. If you must land in San Francisco first, jump into a taxi, pull down the curtains, drive through the city, breaking every speed law, to &ldquo;Third and Townsend,&rdquo; sit in the station until a train &ndash; some train, any train &ndash; pulls out, and go with it. If in crossing Market Street, you raise that taxi-curtain as much as an inch, believe me, stranger, it&rsquo;s all off; you&rsquo;re lost. You&rsquo;ll never leave San Francisco. Myself, both times I have gone to California, I have vowed to see Yosemite, the big trees, the string of beautiful old missions which dot the state, some of the quaint, languid, semi-tropical towns of the south, some of the brisk, brilliant, bustling towns of the north. But I have never really done it because I saw San Francisco first.</p>
<ul>

<p>NYC boasts the best bagels in the world, which New Yorkers attribute to their magical tap water. San Francisco boasts the finest sourdough in the world, which San Franciscans attribute to their special air. The unseen native inhabitants in San Francisco&rsquo;s damp, foggy micro-climate, they claim, create a special &ldquo;microbial terroir&rdquo; that can&rsquo;t be replicated anywhere else.</p>
<p>And for a San Francisco sourdough to be truly &ldquo;authentic,&rdquo; the local history and mythology go, it has to be born in San Francisco with proper San Franciscan air, not in Oakland, Richmond, or San Jose. (BTW, everyone hates Oakland, except people who actually live there and pay half the rent of what people pay in San Francisco while still basically living in San Francisco.)</p>
<p>No one has convinced more people about the unique qualities of San Francisco sourdough than Boudin Bakery, which <a href="https://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Yeast_to_Wheat:_How_Boudin_Bakery%E2%80%99s_Yeast_Culture_Shaped_San_Francisco%E2%80%99s_Counterculture">claims</a> to have been selling the same loaf of bread made with The Original San Francisco Sourdough™ for >170 years. According to the Boudin Bakery museum at the ultra-touristy Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf, the company&rsquo;s mother dough follows an unbroken line back to the Gold Rush in 1849. Louise Boudin even saved the starter from a burning building during the 1906 earthquake. A museum docent will readily inform you the starter is so special and irreplaceable that the Boudin mothership sends its retail stores fresh starter every 23 days. Without it, they emphasize, the sourdough produced at those stores would stop tasting like San Francisco sourdough &ndash; and start tasting like Sacramento or San Diego sourdough, which is absolutely blasphemous.</p>
<p>Also, according to the museum, Boudin&rsquo;s bread owes its special flavor to a particular strain of lactic acid bacteria that thrives <em>only</em> in San Francisco&rsquo;s climate. Scientists identified it here in 1970, so they named it <em>Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis</em>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great, great story. Too bad it&rsquo;s not quite true.</p>
<p>Scientists did identify <em>Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis</em> in San Francisco. But recent studies have found it in <a href=www.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/dining/for-gastronomists-a-go-to-microbiologist.html>90% of the world&rsquo;s sourdough</a>, too. So from a biological standpoint, San Francisco sourdough is not all that distinctive &ndash; or unique to San Francisco.</p>
<p>If you take your precious local sourdough starter and bake with it in Los Angeles, I bet the resulting bread will taste very similar to what you make in San Francisco. Blasphemy! But likely&mldr;true. Even breads made without <em>Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis</em> can taste pretty darn good.</p>
<p>So much for the &ldquo;microbial terroir&rdquo; myth. Even bakers who have been in a position to benefit from the reputation of local sourdough don&rsquo;t embrace the cachet. Call a dog a dog &ndash; it&rsquo;s pure marketing. It sells the city, turning sourdough into another tourist attraction that San Francisco is famous for, besides the bridge and the bay.</p>

<hr>
<p>There are 3 bread institutions in the San Francisco Bay Area: Acme, Semifreddi&rsquo;s, and Tartine.</p>
<p>Acme is often credited as an OG pioneer of the San Francisco Bay Area&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bread Revolution,&rdquo; which in turn galvanized the modern &ldquo;artisan bread&rdquo; movement across America; to this day, Acme&rsquo;s bread remains a &ldquo;benchmark&rdquo; for commercial handmade bread. It was a stalwart of the 1980s artisan baking scene, along with Semifreddi&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Newer upstarts like Tartine and Josey Baker Bread have brought on some serious competition, and challenged the status quo of what San Francisco bread is <em>supposed</em> to taste like and, along the way, the status quo of home baking.</p>
<p>In 2006, the NY Times food columnist Mark Bittman <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/06/dining/06mini.html>wrote about</a> a NYC baker named Jim Lahey, the man behind Sullivan Street Bakery who had developed a no-knead bread recipe that consisted of only 4 steps and required just 4 ingredients &ndash; flour, water, salt, and yeast. While not the OG recipe of its kind, the &ldquo;no-knead&rdquo; method spread like wildfire. It revolutionized the food world; its simplicity miraculously democratized breadmaking for the home baker. Lahey became a semi-god figure &ndash; the Prometheus who gifted the art of breadmaking to the masses. He released a cookbook in 2009, titled <em>My Bread: The Revolutionary No-Work, No-Knead Method</em>.</p>
<p>A few years earlier, a transplanted New Yorker named Elizabeth Pruitt and her husband Chad Robertson moved their tiny baking operation from Point Reyes, California south to an unassuming corner of Guerrero Street, at the edge of the Mission District in San Francisco. They named it Tartine, and churned out artisan breads, viennoiseries and sandwiches. The bakery garnered praise from Alice Waters and Martha Stewart, and made the cake for a <a href=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Why-the-concert-was-canceled-3314257.php>&ldquo;bohemian bourgeois&rdquo;-themed birthday party</a> attended by Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton. Mark Bittman <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/travel/28Bite.html>described</a> their shop as one of the best French-style bakeries in the country, and particularly raved about Tartine&rsquo;s sandwiches, which were made on &ldquo;Mr. Robertson&rsquo;s exceptional bread, notable because it&rsquo;s a slow-fermented yeast bread in very French style that is a welcome change from the ubiquitous sourdough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>San Franciscans started lining up outside the shop to get a taste of what Prueitt and Robertson were baking; the queues outside Tartine became a local landmark and a symbol of a changing city. (Lines beget lines; the success of Tartine&rsquo;s OG location is arguably one of the reasons that San Francisco gained a reputation as a place where people would wait in line for any sort of &ldquo;cult&rdquo; food item.) Tartine&rsquo;s bread started to become a Veblen good, just as Prueitt and Robertson started to become food-world celebrities. In 2010, the influential <em>Tartine Bread</em> was published; Robertson revealed to the world his recipe for French-style sourdough, which called for folding, shaping, scoring, and a grasp of wild yeast. The change from Lahey&rsquo;s no-knead bread to Robertson&rsquo;s sourdough was remarkable; home baking was about to become more technical and more precise.</p>
<p>The complete recipe for Basic Country Bread, the edible hero of <em>Tartine Bread</em>, runs 38 pages, including photographs. It was instantly celebrated as a &ldquo;masterpiece&rdquo; in media, along the lines of a Martin Scorsese tracking shot or a Marcel Proust sentence.</p>
<p>Robertson wrote about bread in a detailed but flexible way: The prose is lean and direct; the instructions don&rsquo;t just tell you what to do but explain why, what to look for, and how to make corrections, encouraging you to see his laborious artisan craft as adaptable and welcoming of interpretation. Robertson was also a laid-back surfer who radiated a particular kind of Gen X bohemianism, which inadvertently imbued breadmaking with a sort of new masculine sheen.</p>
<p>Seemingly, Robertson gave away the store. The bread he teaches you to make is essentially the same bread that has turned him into one of the most influential bakers in the world; it&rsquo;s what causes otherwise rational adults to mob the line at Tartine Bakery. The fact is, Tartine multiplied its influence by opening up about the way they do things.</p>
<p><em>Tartine Bread</em> could have merely been aspirational, but it&rsquo;s just too <em>actionable</em>. The recipes work, and they inspire. All of a sudden, many of Tartine&rsquo;s fans took up artisan baking at home &ndash; a majority of whom happened to be guys in tech.</p>
<p>For tech geeks in the San Francisco Bay Area, <em>Tartine Bread</em> had it all:</p>
<ul>
<li>a recipe that encouraged iteration and a grasp of the scientific nature of wild fermentation;</li>
<li>a craft that was not frivolous or quintessentially feminine like making cupcakes; and</li>
<li>a cool leader that inspires emulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Technologists stormed sourdough with a host of tools and techniques that built on Robertson&rsquo;s artisan approach. Ken Forkish, who had quit his job at IBM to become a baker, wrote <em>Flour Water Salt Yeast</em> and won a James Beard Award in 2013. Nathan Myhrvold, the former CTO of Microsoft and current CEO of patent and investment firm Intellectual Ventures, released a 5-volume cookbook called <em>Modernist Bread</em> in 2017. It also won a James Beard. High-efficiency tools like $150 Brød & Taylor Folding Bread Proofer that offers &ldquo;precision control&rdquo; over temperature and humidity, or the $300 Fourneau bread oven, which &ldquo;traps steam and radiates powerful heat&rdquo; and &ldquo;helps you achieve oven spring&rdquo;, came on the market.</p>
<p>Overnight, Silicon Valley venture capitalists started tweeting about their fine sourdough starters; UX designers started buying $600 bannetons and taking extensive notes about each bake in apps like Evernote, Google Keep, Notion and Bear; and tender #crumbshots popped up all over breadstagram. Everyone in Silicon Valley is Very Publicly Into Sourdough All of a Sudden. People couldn&rsquo;t delight more in the miracles of this alchemy than if it were neolithic times and bread was just invented yesterday. Breadmaking has become the latest form of romantic consumerism.</p>

<p>The Perfect Loaf, a sourdough bread blog launched in 2013 by Maurizio Leo, a software engineer by trade, is frequently cited as an entry point to baking for men in tech, as his approach speaks to technically-oriented individuals and, as his blog name implies, is pursuant of mastery.</p>
<p>Breadmaking is now seen as a sort of an &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s expected to produce a certain result and if that result isn&rsquo;t always what you expect, you step back and diagnose the steps along the way. Working on bread recipes has become a new form of &ldquo;debugging.&rdquo; That iterative procedure for optimization appeals to the engineering mind, not to mention the precision part. Breadmaking also offers various degrees of freedom &ndash; it could be implemented in lots of different possible ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a liberating escape, particularly when you work in tech for a living and can&rsquo;t turn that technical side of your brain off and your work becomes so embedded in your life that it consumes you.</p>
<p>Like religion, romanticism also has its liminal rituals, which decouple the subjective feelings of pleasure and freedom from material goods and mass-marketed symbols, and disrupt the daily tedium and hierarchies, transporting us, through the consumption of goods and services labeled romantic, into a fantastic world in which ordinary annoyances, our own limitations and, with a little luck, even our most objectionable caprices, are temporarily interrupted. Maybe baking is an opportunity for these technologists to rehabilitate their humanity, when they are not busy creating apps that make money off everyone&rsquo;s &ldquo;addiction&rdquo;?</p>
<p><em>Sourdough</em>, a 2017 novel by Robin Sloan, pokes fun at the obnoxious foodie culture of Silicon Valley while also ribbing the folks who are so eager to innovate it &ndash; the tech guys who obsess over an ancient idea, commit to disrupting it, then get bored and move on.</p>
<p>The reason that Chad Robertson became a god among tech-oriented breadmaking hobbyists is perhaps more shallow than one might think: Robertson and Tartine are instrumental to this whole trend because he was in San Francisco just as this mid-2000s tech wave was taking off. Right place, right time. Right guy, right craft.</p>
<p>When Robertson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHUU9dcHVng">spoke</a> about the intersection of tech and bread at a Wired conference in 2015, he said as much, noting that the reason he and Prueitt even moved their bakery to San Francisco in the first place was because the burst of the dotcom bubble in the early 2000s finally made it affordable for them to do so: The median rent for a two-bedroom apartment had fallen from $3,000 a month to just under $2,000. Development had slowed, evictions and unemployment had spiked, and commercial vacancies had risen. In the Mission District, a historically working-class and Latino neighborhood, artists' spaces battled with real-estate developers.</p>
<p>Tartine had thrived during an economic downturn. Now it&rsquo;s operating in one of the most expensive cities in the world, where a 21-year-old earning low six-figures is considered a peasant.</p>

<hr>
<p>Tartine has undergone rapid expansion since Chad Robertson personally manned the ovens at the OG store on Guerrero Street, shuttling out a limited number of loaves every evening.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Oakland-born and San Francisco-raised Blue Bottle, the most dominant company riding the &ldquo;third wave&rdquo; coffee trend, had just <a href=https://valleywag.gawker.com/blue-bottle-which-raised-45-m-cut-health-benefits-fo-1663442765>raised $45 million dollars</a> in venture capital for its own expansion, and needed a bakery partner to provide food in its coffee shops. Tartine soon announced a <a href=https://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-tartine-blue-bottle-merging-20150420-story.html>merger</a> with the company; the news turned heads in the northern California food world and beyond. Anticipating a personal windfall, Prueitt and Robertson moved into a luxurious circa 1960 house in the Castro district in 2015. Eater SF did a <a href=https://sf.eater.com/2016/2/23/11098328/tartine-bakery-liz-prueitt-chad-robertson-home-kitchen#11>photo shoot</a> of their newly remodeled home kitchen, showing off their specialized kitchenware and verdant backyard.</p>
<p>By February 2016 when the Eater piece went live, the Blue Bottle acquisition had <a href=https://www.sfchronicle.com/restaurants/article/Blue-Bottle-and-Tartine-Bakery-nix-merger-6673950.php>fallen apart</a>. The couple put the Castro house up for sale and quietly moved out in early 2018. Still, Tartine Manufactory, a restaurant and bar concept conceived in their sleek, airy home kitchen, opened in the summer of 2016. <a href=https://sf.eater.com/2016/8/17/12513334/tartine-manufactory-san-francisco-mission-photos>Eater SF</a> lauded the 5,000-sqft space as &ldquo;an artisanal utopia in the Mission&rdquo;; every detail was designed to represent &ldquo;a new type of luxury.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Tartine launched its own coffee brand, <a href=https://sprudge.com/tartines-coffee-manufactory-roasting-destiny-san-francisco-107956.html>Coffee Manufactory</a>, in partnership with a former Starbucks executive who is now the Chief Operations Officer of Tartine.</p>
<p>One of Tartine&rsquo;s partners and investors is a real-estate private-equity firm called CIM Group, one of the largest property owners in Los Angeles and a prominent commercial landlord in Oakland, managing about $30 billion dollars in assets.</p>
<p>Tartine&rsquo;s Coffee Manufactory planned to move into Jack London Square, a 434,000-sqft waterfront property in Oakland acquired by CIM in 2016 as part of a <a href=https://www.sfchronicle.com/restaurants/article/Jack-London-Square-cooks-up-a-new-generation-of-11231529.php>$131 million deal</a> for long-term development. CIM billed the Coffee Manufactory as an anchor tenant &ndash; a business that could attract customers and other businesses, increasing the overall value and cachet of the area. The developer was curating the neighborhood with buildings and tenants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tartine was a particularly appealing anchor tenant. The food was great, and most of it could be made off-site, requiring a fairly modest square footage for retail sites. And Tartine had a history: the flagship location, with its artistic staff and communal ambiance, radiated the sort of authenticity that a real-estate developer could only dream of cultivating. Year on year, Tartine’s brand had become cooler, airier, and more transportable.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Images of Tartine&rsquo;s pastries and its OG Guerrero Street bakery started to pop up in <a href=hhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/michellerial/morning-bun>Apple commercials and product demos</a>. Sweetgreen, the East Coast fast-casual salad chain that was now proliferating along the West Coast, started to offer &ldquo;<a href=https://sf.eater.com/2017/8/30/16227094/sweetgreen-tartine-manufactory-salad-bowl-san-francisco-bay>The Tartine Bowl</a>&rdquo;, plucked from Prueitt&rsquo;s recently published book <em>Tartine All Day</em>.</p>
<p>Tartine&rsquo;s brand became another recognizable symbol of <a href=https://archive.is/mmUwT>gentrification</a>; the opening of a Tartine seemed to hint that a neighborhood was on the cusp of it. The process of bringing intense, aggressive real-estate development to upper-middle-class neighborhoods, to cater to an even more affluent stratum, is gentrification on steroids.</p>
<p>In January 2019, Tartine opened <a href=https://sf.eater.com/2019/1/22/18193239/manufactory-food-hall-sfo-tartine-cala-kamine-san-francisco-international-airport>the Manufactory Food Hall</a> in San Francisco International Airport.</p>
<p>That spring, Tartine opened a splashy <a href=https://la.eater.com/2019/1/28/18200748/manufactory-row-tartine-chris-bianco-los-angeles-photos-inside>new 40,000-sqft Tartine Manufactory</a> &ndash; three times the size of its first Manufactory in San Francisco &ndash; in the Row, a huge, newly developed compound in Downtown Los Angeles (DTLA). <em>Food & Wine</em> published a feature on Robertson and Prueitt, with the headline &ldquo;With L.A. Opening, Tartine Positions Itself for World Domination.&rdquo; F*ck yeah, Silicon Valley-style.</p>
<p>CIM invested in Tartine&rsquo;s 5 new locations in Los Angeles (<a href=https://la.eater.com/2019/1/10/18177207/tartine-silver-lake-sunset-coming-expansion-news>Silver Lake</a>, <a href=https://la.eater.com/2019/7/29/20746164/tartine-hollywood-bakery-san-francisco-opening-sycamore-news>West Hollywood</a>, <a href=https://la.eater.com/2019/9/6/20853090/tartine-bakery-santa-monica-expansion-opening-funeral-home>Santa Monica</a>, <a href=https://www.thebrassy.com/blog/west-adams-tartine-is-a-welcome-neighborhood-addition>West Adams</a>, and <a href=https://la.eater.com/2022/2/1/22912646/tartine-pasadena-new-cafe-opening-restaurant-los-angeles-morning-am-intel-news>Pasadena</a>). For any Angeleno who&rsquo;s ever wondered just how all these Tartines landed in the Southland in the first place, here&rsquo;s an answer.</p>
<p>In July 2019, Tartine opened its 3rd San Francisco location, in a CIM-affiliated property in the Inner Sunset neighborhood.</p>
<p>In September 2019, Tartine opened its 5th Bay Area location in <a href=https://sf.eater.com/2019/9/16/20868239/tartine-berkeley-bakery-open-graduate-hotel>Berkeley</a>. The café is tucked into a sunroom at Berkeley&rsquo;s Graduate Hotel (fka. the Hotel Durant), a chain hotel owned by Adventurous Journeys Capital, a self-described &ldquo;vertically integrated real estate investment manager focused on developing and operating transformative real estate assets in spaces often overlooked or undervalued by traditional investment firms.&rdquo; Tartine&rsquo;s new presence at the hotel came as part of a ~$50 million transformation from the Hotel Durant to the Graduate Hotel.</p>
<p>Customers who walk into any of Tartine&rsquo;s locations may never feel or realize they are entering part of a real-estate empire.</p>
<p>How much of Tartine is owned by CIM and how deeply these two companies are intertwined has never been publicly disclosed. The daughter of a co-founder of CIM is now Tartine&rsquo;s VP of Brand.</p>
<figure><img loading=lazy src=/img/california-dreamin-2/20230220_190301.jpg alt="Joaquin Oro pan de San Joaquín baked"><figcaption class=right><p>100% wholegrain <em>pan de San Joaquín</em>, gleaming in the wintry sun.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Today, Tartine operates 3 locations in the San Francisco Bay Area, 5 in Los Angeles, and 6 licensed locations in Seoul (one of which is located at <a href=https://tartinebakery.com/seoul/dosan>Kinfolk Dosan</a>, a cultural space created by Kinfolk, an aspirational lifestyle magazine). How can a craft bakery still be artisanal if it has 6 overseas branches?</p>
<p>Tartine&rsquo;s workers in San Francisco watched investment flow into the new locations and increasingly felt neglected. They suspected they were the actual engine that propelled Tartine into an empire, but now they couldn&rsquo;t even get a $1/hour raise. There was a lot of confusion about the company&rsquo;s investors &ndash; who were they, and how much power did they wield? Money to pay invoices wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Tartine was expanding, but the OG Mission location was falling apart. In November 2019, the San Francisco Department of Public Health <a href=https://sf.eater.com/2019/11/23/20979306/tartine-rats-rodents-dph-mission>briefly shut down</a> Tartine&rsquo;s Guerrero Street location, after inspectors say that its operators failed to deal with a persistent rodent infestation in the space.</p>

<p>Workers noticed cultural changes. Shift wine was eliminated, and management introduced a monthly music playlist. Some were dissatisfied with wages, raises, and scheduling. Employees wanted certain benefits, such as paid time off separate from state-mandated sick leave, and raises larger than the annual increases mandated by the city. All this looked feasible to them, given the company’s expansion. When they brought these requests to Tartine’s newly created human-resources department, they were confused to find that it was run out of offices leased from CIM affiliates, in Los Angeles.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As Tartine expanded rapidly in the last 6-7 years, operational difficulties grew with it. Money was allocated to ventures that didn&rsquo;t pan out. The whole enterprise seemed stretched thin. There seemed to be a fundamental disconnect between perception and reality. New investment was focused on new ventures, but Tartine&rsquo;s expansion relied on the strength of its brand.</p>
<p>Bar Tartine closed in 2016 and had never turned a profit (since it opened in 2005 just a couple of blocks away from the OG Tartine Bakery). The planned Coffee Manufactory retail space in Jack London Square never opened.</p>
<p>In December 2019, Tartine&rsquo;s massive DTLA Manufactory shuttered &ndash; 11 months after it opened. It was a shocking closure. The store laid off its remaining workers 10 days before Christmas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tartine’s market, retail baking and takeaway spaces, and multiple restaurants all closed this week after just 11 months of business and a build-out rumored to have run into the tens of millions of dollars. All of the Row is struggling to find sustained weeknight retail traffic right now, but the loss of anchor tenant Tartine has hit the development’s brand particularly hard. There simply were not enough $72 mug buyers around to keep the place afloat, and that seems to say something about Tartine’s visibility and draw, and about the Row overall — not to mention the cost of goods inside. &mldr;</p>
<p>Simply put: Tartine didn’t find a good way to consistently speak to Angelenos, and in a city where driving four miles to have dinner can mean sitting in your car for an hour, answering the “why” of the place not only proved tricky, it likely proved its undoing. &mldr; More than anything, it struggled to define its place at the Row, in Downtown, in a city brimming with home bakers and panaderias and other local bread legends like Friends & Family, Clark Street, and Bub & Grandma’s.</p>

<p>Tartine took on a new investor, Monogram Capital Partners, another private-equity firm &ldquo;focused exclusively on consumer and retail companies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chad Robertson started to show up in <a href=https://www.facebook.com/BlundstoneUS/videos/live-in-my-blundstones-chad-robertson/2553319681570138/>sponsored content</a> for <a href=https://www.blundstone.com/limb-chad-robertson>Blundstone boots</a> on social media. He and Prueitt divorced in 2020.</p>
<p>Given the PE industry&rsquo;s typical M.O. (i.e. the decade-long pyramiding of real estate and overleveraging on ever lower interest rates), I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Tartine is sinking deeper and deeper into debt &ndash; or might eventually end up like <a href=/posts/aquaboogie-di-dolce>Dean & DeLuca</a>.</p>
<p>In February 2020, a few short weeks before the Covid lockdown, 141 of Tartine&rsquo;s >200 San Francisco Bay Area employees signed a letter, announcing their decision to unionize with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. It came as a huge surprise, especially at a world-renowned bakery that boasts about ​"production at a human scale" and has been a training ground for young bakers from around the globe.</p>
<p>Tartine&rsquo;s management declined to recognize the union, and <a href=https://sf.eater.com/2020/2/11/21133479/tartine-union-management-sam-singer>hired Sam Singer</a>, a longtime San Francisco crisis communications expert known for his work with controversial companies like Chevron&rsquo;s Richmond oil refinery. After letting him go amid criticism, they then hired a Las Vegas-based firm called Quest Consulting to quash the unionizing effort. Quest&rsquo;s founder, Lupe Cruz, has earned himself a <a href=https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/union-organizers-and-workers-decry-union-busting-consulting-firms-hired-b/>reputation</a> among labor organizers as &ldquo;a notorious union-buster who specializes in influencing Latino-dominated workforces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In March 2021, over a year after voting and following a thorny, protracted dispute over 24 challenged ballots, the National Labor Relations Board announced that Tartine&rsquo;s workers in San Francisco had officially unionized. In May 2022, the Tartine Union began negotiations for its first wage and healthcare contract, which <a href=https://sf.eater.com/2022/8/23/23318336/tartine-bakery-union-negotiations>stalled</a> a few months later.</p>

<p>A single person at the right place comes up with a &ldquo;unique&rdquo; recipe at the right time can have the outsized effect of influencing a whole new generation of bakers, and even become a cult figure.</p>

<p>No single part of Tartine&rsquo;s technique or bread is new or original to me. I&rsquo;ve eaten there several times; nothing about it has blown my mind. Maybe it was groundbreaking a decade ago to the culinarily ignorant masses who grew up on industrial wheatish pulp?</p>
<p>That one guy who lives in San Francisco at the right time with the right trade shouldn&rsquo;t get all the credit for this bread renaissance &ndash; East Coast journalists began to protest. People (mostly women) have been baking bread at home for thousands of years before Robertson and Prueitt opened Tartine.</p>
<p>Apparently, &ldquo;nerds&rdquo; over-engineering breadbaking, turning this homegrown, down-to-earth craft into something more technical and complicated than it should be, and &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; women out in the process is <a href=https://www.eater.com/2018/11/19/18099127/bread-silicon-valley-sourdough-tech-bros-tartine-chad-robertson>a huge problem</a>. The gendering of baking has become a hot topic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&mldr;one of my favorite things about JavaScript is when we discover things 20 years after other languages, besides like the concept of baking your own bread at home instead of purchasing it from the store, we act like we invented fat arrow functions, classes, immutable data, restructuring statements, functional programming &ndash; like, it&rsquo;s like truly wild to witness.</p>
<p>&mldr;this baking bread thing seems to have come out of like nowhere and it&rsquo;s interesting to see. &mldr; I was going to make fun of the parallels between baking bread &ndash; like baking bread from a recipe and implementing an algorithm of code, but I think that the real interesting and problematic parallel is the rhetoric with which JavaScript developers talk about bread. It&rsquo;s super elitist and it&rsquo;s mostly dudes.</p>
<p>why are there no women in tech baking bread? And I feel like &ndash; this is in all seriousness, I feel this pressure now to stop this in its tracks. &mldr; I&rsquo;m worried about fucking bread. Like, you think I&rsquo;d have enough emotional labor as a woman in tech to have to deal with baking bread &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>People in and around San Francisco making sourdough is such a surprising and novel phenomenon that it needs to be picked apart &ndash; because (<em>gasp</em>!) they happen to be men who work in tech and ruin whatever they lay their hands on for the sake of fashion and &ldquo;disruption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the pseudo-celebrity status of Chad Robertson, the ubiquity of Instagram shots that emphasize only the visual aesthetic of breads, etc. speak to humans' shallowness and egotism more than anything else.</p>
<p>Who cares about some JavaScript developer in San Francisco who bakes bread at home and runs a blog about it? If anything, it&rsquo;s those who follow them keenly on social media that affirm their authority and turn them into some bread gods. Why are you so desperate for external validation?</p>
<p>A lot of people think that to be a real developer/baker, you need to be prolific on social media. If you don&rsquo;t argue about your trade on Twitter, GitHub or Instagram, you don&rsquo;t <em>feel like</em> you are a real developer/baker. Yeah sure. Only if you <em>choose</em> to play this game and be stuck in this rat race.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the scientific approach to bread is a futile endeavor. Why can&rsquo;t the scientific and the intuitive approaches co-exist?</p>
<p>The foundation of bread is super simple and those basic principles are still unchanged. I disagree that it&rsquo;s total hubris to be attempting to innovate and move the art forward. Some folks are actually making significant innovations in breadmaking, and innovation is not an &ldquo;American sickness&rdquo; that needs to be cured. (In fact, I would argue that America needs more innovation &ndash; especially in manufacturing and engineering &ndash; that will tangibly improve the standard of living.) Breads produced with some of the new artisan methods today are actually really good &ndash; in ways that their predecessors simply were not. Just because something has been around for thousands of years doesn&rsquo;t mean there aren&rsquo;t many new discoveries to be had. Hell, it wasn&rsquo;t until a couple of decades ago that people picked up on the fact that you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> have to knead the dough to make great bread. Sometimes little things like this go undiscovered because no one bothered to look.</p>
<p>Only very recently in history has certain technology become available to us that has allowed us to exert super precise control over the baking environment (e.g. ambient temperatures, steam, etc.) and ingredients (e.g. varieties of grain, grinds, flour blends, strains of yeast). Bread keeps getting better and better because some bakers continue to tinker endlessly with these variables. New scientific analysis could herald a &ldquo;golden age of fermentation.&rdquo; Sure, not everyone cares about these things. For most people, bread is bread.</p>
<p>As a baker, you should remove ego from your <em>mise en place</em>, rethink your take on baking, and do some researching and discovering for new techniques and skills. There&rsquo;s always room for improvement. And maybe, just maybe, you could find some new excitement, or get your mind blown, and impart that joy and passion through your baking. Every person that eats your bakes deserves that.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been baking my whole life. My mom never baked bread, and I didn&rsquo;t eat much bread growing up. I actually loathed baking for most of my life &ndash; kneading or using a dough mixer (another thing you have to wash) is absolutely tedious, and handling raw ingredients like eggs is totally disgusting. I didn&rsquo;t have <a href=/posts/harpys-lovesong/>my first taste of artisan sourdough bread</a> until 2014. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t discover breadmaking until ~2019, well after the &ldquo;tech bros&rdquo; had invaded the sourdough trend and maybe even moved on, and after <a href=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/bread-makes-a-comeback><em>The New Yorker</em> declared</a> a comeback for bread and greeted it as the giddy limit of fake trendspotting.</p>
<p>I was initially drawn to breadmaking because of the science behind it &ndash; the microbiology and cellular gastronomy &ndash; more than the intuitive part. To me, sourdough brought bread back from the dead. Now I&rsquo;m more enthused about transforming different grains into good bread. It&rsquo;s not about making disruptive breads, but making breads that I really like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tech bros invading sourdough&rdquo; is not some panic-inducing mass-epidemic of nerds suddenly swarming every supermarket by the thousands for artisan flours and baking tools. ~4 years in, I&rsquo;m still the only person I know who makes bread on a regular basis. Many types of people all over the world are getting more interested in breadmaking and trying it out, but it&rsquo;s still pretty rare for someone to commit to it at the same level as myself.</p>
<p>As a side note, I think the fact that producing some common food item at home is now seen as &ldquo;novel&rdquo; speaks volumes about how removed we postmodern humans are from our food. Tovala and DoorDash are good examples.</p>

<p>My second experiment with Joaquin Oro (shared by friends at the California Wheat Commission) pushes the limits of dough hydration. Gorging the Joaquin Oro grown in water-scarce California with an absurd amount of water is quite the California conundrum.</p>

<p>Poolish modifies gluten, weakening it somewhat, so the dough stretches better as it ferments. For a strong-flour dough, a poolish will help bread rise taller.</p>

<p>The process is built upon my previous <a href=/posts/aquaboogie-van-wheatsworth/>wholegrain <em>pan de cristal</em> loaves</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Autolyse the flour at 80% hydration for 2 hours in the fridge.</li>
<li>Add the poolish, levain, and azuki bean purée. Mix until well incorporated.</li>
<li>Double hydration: Slowly drizzle in 2/3 of the remaining water, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgz0oAhgwyg">Rubaud-mix</a> until thoroughly absorbed. This requires a bit of patience, so take your time. Cover the dough and let it rest for 20 minutes at room temperature.</li>
<li>Add the salt, and mix well.</li>
<li>Triple hydration: Slowly add the rest of the water, while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgz0oAhgwyg">Rubaud-mixing</a> until completely combined. Let the dough rest for another 20 minutes at room temperature.</li>
<li>Gently mix in the olive oil and softened tallow. Let the dough rest and relax for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Bulk ferment the dough at ~70°F for 4 hours, performing a coil-fold every 30 minutes during the first 2.5 hours. Folding a super-high-hydration dough like this kinda feels like handling water.</li>
<li>Transfer the dough into a fridge and retard for 12 hours.</li>
<li>Take the dough out of the fridge; divide it into two or leave it whole as a large loaf. Let it rest at room temperature for 2-3 hours (no shaping necessary).</li>
<li>Bake as usual: 25-30 minutes at 350°F.</li>
</ol>
<p>I divided the dough into two approximately equal portions, baked one in the toaster oven, and kept the other one in the fridge for another 8 hours.</p>

<p>Instead of baking the 20-hour retarded piece in an oven, I brought it to a Mardi Gras BBQ thingy and cooked it in a cast-iron skillet on a charcoal-fired grill. Who says February is a month to simply be endured &ndash; a penance to pay before late winter yields to spring?</p>
<p>Magic happens when meat meets charcoal smoke. What about breads?</p>
<figure><img loading=lazy src=/img/california-dreamin-2/20230220_190227.jpg alt="Joaquin Oro pan de San Joaquín baked">
</figure>
<p>I tossed a handful of black walnut and pistachio shells into the grill towards the end. Nut shells release a great smokey aroma when they burn, due to the oils that naturally occur in the shells. They burn pretty easily and add a marvelous boost of smoky sweetness to food.</p>

<p>This grilled <em>pan de San Joaquín</em> delivers an exciting punch of smoky char in first bite.</p>

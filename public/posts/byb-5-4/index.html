</blockquote>
<p>Key West, the southernmost point of the continental US, is one of my favorite summer spots. Ernest Hemingway once said Key West was &ldquo;a St. Tropez of the poor.&rdquo; He came for a day and ended up staying for a decade.</p>
<p>The island is still a source of endless joy: fishing, scuba diving, dancing, slumming, and drinking. The most beautiful thing about Key West is spending the night on the beach (not the best in Florida), swimming there as if it were daytime, and tanning, like vampires, under the moonlight. And I always like to bring <em>medianoches</em> and <em>chicharones</em>.</p>
<p>This time, I drank lots of corn. First of all, a fermented <em>chicha morada</em> (I can&rsquo;t stand the sweet and fruity non-fermented version), made with Peruvian purple corn, pineapple, apples, lime, and spices. It tasted like a <em>kombucha</em>. Next, a <em>chicha venezolana</em>, which turned out more like a Mexican <em>horchata</em>. On my way out, I drank homemade <em>chicha de jora</em> and ate <em>estofado de carne</em> (rich and flavorful beef stew with garden vegetables and <em>chicha de jora</em>); the stew reminded me of <em>bœuf bourguignon</em> and was a lot better than this Ohio &ldquo;delicacy&rdquo; called Cincinnati chili 3-way I had earlier at Skyline just outside Fort Lauderdale, which is a pound of shredded cheese on top of mediocre chili on top of poorly cooked spaghetti.</p>
<p>These brought back good memories of backpacking in Peru and eating at <em>picanterías</em>, where <em>chicha morada</em> and <em>chicha de jora</em> are commonly brewed in-house.</p>
<p><em>Chicha</em> is an ancient pre-Columbian corn drink widespread in the Andes. It was absolutely essential to the Incas; for them it was a fundamental domestic product, traded from coast to inland, up and down the continent. <em>Chicha</em> was a community necessity, a ritual libation, an imperative social lubricant to the Incas' communication with the gods, a drink worthy of being sipped by a farmer straight out of a clay pot as well as lapped up by the sun itself out of a gold vessel.</p>
<p>The brewing process for <em>chicha</em> is essentially <a href=https://beerconnoisseur.com/articles/chicha-bolivias-tart-beer>similar</a> to that of European-style beer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doña Leonor Mariscal, 70 years old, does just that for her fellow villagers. In her tiny ramshackle building, once a chicheria itself, she steeps the corn and lets it germinate a bit on a large piece of cloth laid out in the sun, directly on the cobblestone street in front of her building. The sun is sometimes hot enough to dry out her corn malt, but she admits to using ashes sometimes to complete the process. She then bags the malt and lets the area chicha brewers grind this corn into a flour at their own breweries. &mldr;</p>
<p>The fermentation therefore seems to be nearly entirely carried out by the natural content of the corn. Many traditional cochabambina brewers like Doña Narcissa do not seem aware that the lactic acid bacteria contained within the corn is the true origin of the alcohol, light fizz and acidic flavor of their brew. But what matters is that they are always able to quench chicha lovers' thirst for delicate tartness; the science behind their brewing methods isn&rsquo;t a major concern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Outside Latin America, the one thing most people remember about <em>chicha</em> is that it&rsquo;s often fermented with human saliva. In particular, <em>chicha de jora</em> (<em>jora</em> is a specific kind of yellow maize) is typically prepared by chewing said corn into a clump before fermenting it into a boozy concoction. Since the starch in corn is well locked into the grain kernel and thus unavailable for fermentation on its own, chewing allows the enzymes (e.g. amylases) in your mouth to break down the starch into sugar.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The chewing inevitably raises many eyebrows. The idea of consuming a drink brewed from someone else&rsquo;s saliva is viscerally disturbing, particularly in the post-COVID era. Using saliva as a fermentation starter is not unique to South America, however; there&rsquo;s evidence that chewing as a way of kicking off fermentation was practiced in prehistoric Europe before the emergence of malting; Finnish folklore tells the legend of a woman by the name of Kalevatar, who invented beer by mixing honey with bear saliva; some traditional Japanese <em>sakes</em>, such as <em>kuchikamizake</em> (口噛み酒, meaning &ldquo;mouth-chewed <em>sake</em>"), are made from chewed rice; and <em>kava</em>, produced by the peoples of the Pacific Islands from chewing the roots of kava (aka. <em>Piper methysticum G. Forst</em>), was born in this way.</p>
<p>Fetishes and aesthetics aside, saliva contains diverse microbiomes, and each person&rsquo;s saliva is different and therefore gives different flavors to the fermented product.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been smitten with grain corns. You may remember the loaf of <a href=/posts/byb-4/>blue corn bread</a> I made with East Coast ale yeast a few weeks ago. This time, inspired by the wonderful Peruvian corn dishes and drinks I had in Key West, I&rsquo;d like to up the corn percentage and make a Portuguese-style <em>broa de milho</em>.</p>

<p>Some brewers have described dealing with malted corn as &ldquo;pure, unadulterated pain from hell&rdquo; that comes in many folds:</p>
<ol>
<li>Malted corn has low diastatic power &ndash; barely 35 °L. That&rsquo;s hardly enough to fully convert itself, and requires exogenous amylase from either malted barley or powdered additive.</li>
<li>Corn has a higher gelatinization temperature than barley to break apart the starch molecules. Boiling corn would do the trick. However, high temperatures will kill those natural enzymes meant to convert the starches to fermentable sugars.</li>
<li>Also, while corncobs as a whole do have husks, the corn kernels do not contain husks, making lautering comparable to the 9th layer of hell. Luckily, this challenge doesn&rsquo;t exist in solid beer (aka. bread).</li>
<li>Undermodifed malts, including corn, have dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in spades, so when you combine the two you may develop unpleasant off-flavors if the proper precautions aren&rsquo;t taken.</li>
</ol>
<p>You know, none of this sounds that excruciating to me.</p>
<p>If you really are a single-malt purist, you will</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>chew the corn to break it into smaller bits for the mash and add the enzymes from your saliva that will break down the starches to sugars; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>go through European-style triple-decoction mashing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t that much of a purist, then you need to add exogenous enzymes. One way is to add dry amylase powder; another is to use some pale barley malt to get the enzymes.</p>

</figure>
<p>I wanted to do the single-malt triple-decoction mashing, because mashing is fun and I had never done an all-corn mash before.</p>

<p>Since maize doesn&rsquo;t contain large amounts of phytase, acid rest isn&rsquo;t necessary.</p>
<p>I started the mixture at ~125°F where I left it for 2 hours (protein rest). Then I decocted 1/3 of the mash and boiled it for 2 minutes. I tasted a small sample of the decoction &ndash; it was insanely sweet, and reminded me of a Southern cornbread but slightly more starchy.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, I added the boiled decoction back to the main mash and it raised the temperature to 150°F. I held the mash at ~150°F for the next 5 hours, turning the stove top burner on occasionally to keep the temperature consistent. Further sweetness didn&rsquo;t begin to manifest until the end of it, with plenty of residual starchiness. So I decocted 1/3 of the mash again, and boiled for 2 minutes; when I returned the decoction to the main mash, it brought up the temperature to 158°F, where I left it for another 2.5 hours. Lastly, I decocted 1/3 of the mash again, raising the temperature of the main mash to 168°F &ndash; and held it there for 1 hour.</p>
<p>After all that, starch was no longer perceivable to my tongue. The saccharified corn mash had the fragrance of sweet corn cookies, with intriguing background notes of chestnuts. It tasted insanely sweet and malty, and had a distinct caramelized corn flavor &ndash; almost like a corn muffin. I quite enjoyed the mash, and honestly could have devoured it as is (like a breakfast porridge or dessert).</p>

<p>Once the saccharified corn mash had cooled off to body temperature, I measured 150g out into a separate bowl for yeast inoculation, reserving the remaining 552g in the fridge until needed.</p>

<p>Framgarden expresses a tropical profile with lots of pineapple leading the way and subtler notes of hay and white pepper in the background.</p>
<p>Escarpment&rsquo;s recommended temperature range for Framgarden is quite wide (68-95°F). I let the inoculated mash ferment, loosely covered, at 80-85°F for 12 hours.</p>

<p>I mixed the wholegrain rye flour with the yeast slurry until thoroughly hydrated, and let the mixture ferment (loosely covered) at ~68°F for 12 hours. I didn&rsquo;t expect this to biotransform or ferment much &ndash; it was more of a soaker (à la Peter Reinhart&rsquo;s <em>Whole Grain Breads</em>) that utilized excess liquid yeast, in this case, to thoroughly hydrate the whole grains and enhance flavors in the final bread.</p>
<p>Oh boy, biotransformation kicked off as soon as I mixed everything together; the artificial fruit aroma didn&rsquo;t get as overwhelming as in my first <a href=/posts/byb-5-1/>POG bomb</a>, but very noticeable. I started to regret underestimating this &ldquo;weapon of mass thiolization&rdquo;&mldr;</p>
<p>After ~12 hours, the soaker showed slight signs of fermentation and smelled pungently fruity &ndash; Mr. Fusion-powered DeLorean time machine was back in full stride. A hyperrealistic simulacrum. A hallucinatory fantasy. It reminded me of a quote from Jean Baudrillard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What every society looks for in continuing to produce, and to overproduce, is to restore the real that escapes it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, Untitled Art in Waunakee, WI just released a <a href=https://www.drinkuntitled.com/product/non-alcoholic-berliner-weisse/>non-alcoholic <em>Berliner Weisse</em></a> brewed with London Tropics, de-alcoholized with membrane filtration technologies.</p>
<p>Since thiols are more soluble in alcohols than in water, doesn&rsquo;t the filtration remove quite a bit of the thiols as well? I wonder how much of the fruity aroma/flavor from Tropics remains in the NA beer. As far as I know, de-alcoholization generally removes the fermentation products &ndash; which can be added back in, but that process can be pretty violent to the flavor structure of the beer and, most notably, quite expensive.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t arrested fermentation (e.g. interrupting full attenuation) with Tropics make more sense in producing NA beers? In my bread experiments, London Tropics kicks off biotransformation waaaay before attenuation.</p>

<p>I mixed all of the ingredients together into a homogeneous dough, and let it ferment at ~73°F for 2 hours. Then I shaped it into a <em>boule</em>, and placed it in a proofing colander liberally coated with toasted oat bran. The dough was left to proof at ~58°F for 14 hours.</p>
<p>Once I got the BBQ grill to 400°F, I flipped the dough into a cast-iron skillet and slid it onto the grill. I added black walnut shells to the bottom of the grill, closed the lid, and let the bread bake at 400°F for 1 hour.⁠</p>

<p>Summer is a completely different experience when you know how to grill.</p>
<p>The crust came out thick, smoky, charred, and crunchy; the inside moist and tender, plush with a flavor that absolutely reverberated with corn. Mouthfuls of smokiness, too. The tropical fruit profile got subdued by the wonderful smoky flavor of open-fire bakery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that perfect, forever corn bread that I want to bring to the beach. The summer wish I never knew I had.</p>

<p>This corn bread went so well with summer salads and snacky things. I took it to a park today, along with some butter (not optional), and enjoyed the hell out of it under a tree, while watching the clouds float across the sky.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.</p>

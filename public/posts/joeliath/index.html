<h4 id=coffee-grounds-are-edible>Coffee grounds are edible<a href=#coffee-grounds-are-edible class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Back in my college days, whenever I needed to pull some all-nighters, I would always chew on a handful of chocolate-covered Colombian coffee beans.</p>
<p>A while ago, I got some Ethiopian Amaro Gayo green coffee beans. I roasted them at home until just after the first crack, and have been drinking the cold brew as my summer morning Joe. It&rsquo;s acidic, floral and citrusy, reminding me of orange marmalade and cocoa.</p>
<p>The zero-waster in me couldn&rsquo;t stand the thought of just throwing out these spent coffee grounds, so memories of chewing gourmet coffee beans in college gave me the idea of incorporating these spent coffee grounds into baked goods. ‚òïüçû</p>
<p>A Danish startup has come up with <a href=https://www.kaffebueno.com/post/introducing-kaffe-bueno-coffee-flour>Kaffe Bueno¬†Flour</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kaffe Bueno¬†Flour¬Æ¬†comes from used coffee grounds,¬†recycled¬†from selected hotels and offices in Copenhagen. Then, we¬†extract¬†the oil inside the grounds and further sterilise¬†them.¬†</p>
<p>The result is a naturally¬†gluten-free coffee flour. Although it comes from coffee, its coffee taste is mostly gone along with the oil extracted. Its taste leans towards nutty,¬†chocolaty side.¬†</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They even have a <a href=https://www.kaffebueno.com/post/how-to-make-sourdough-bread-with-coffee-flour-vegan-recipe>recipe</a> for a coffee sourdough, in which the coffee flour is ~11% of flour weight in the final dough.</p>
<p>Dan Lepard has a formula for his famous <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20190908145402/https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/dan-lepard-s-black-pepper-rye>Black Pepper Rye</a>, which uses brewed black coffee to make a roux with a rye first.</p>
<p>So, on the spur of the moment, I strained some coffee grounds from my cold brew, and left them to dry over a dehumidifier for a few hours. When the grounds were thoroughly dry, I ground them again in a coffee grinder to yield a much finer &ldquo;coffee flour.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id=white-wheat--white-flour>White wheat =/= white flour<a href=#white-wheat--white-flour class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>I wanted to use mild-tasting flour for this bread, so the coffee flavor can come through. Colorado Windy White, a modern hard white winter wheat (HWWW) variety grown by Sunflower Acres (the retail front is Grains from the Plains), fits the bill.</p>
<p>When you grind up white wheat to make flour, it looks off-white, kind of like unbleached &ldquo;white flour.&rdquo; But they are not the same thing. Most commercial white flour is made from red wheat that has been refined (the bitter, bulky parts of bran and germ are removed, leaving only the starchy endosperm) &ndash; and in most cases it has been treated with bleach and potassium bromate, and then &ldquo;enriched&rdquo; with artificial vitamins since the natural ones have been lost during processing. This results in a homogeneous product with a long shelf life, which produces consistently fluffy baked goods &ndash; but at the cost of nutrition and flavor.</p>
<p>White wheat is pretty much the same as red wheat, except that it has no major genes for bran color. White whole wheat flour has a milder, sweeter flavor than red whole wheat flour, due to lack of phenolic compounds and lower tannin content.</p>
<p>In the US, many breads are made with hard white (whole) wheat containing >= 10% protein:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brands owned by Bimbo, the largest bakery company in the US: Arnold, Sara Lee, Mrs. Bairds, Stroehmann, Freihofer&rsquo;s, EarthGrains, Brownberry, Francisco, Grandma Sycamore&rsquo;s, J.J. Nissen, Lender&rsquo;s Bagels, Oroweat, etc.</li>
<li>Brands owned by Flowers Foods, the second largest bakery company in the US: Wonder Bread, Nature&rsquo;s Own, Captain John Derst&rsquo;s, Sunbeam, Evangeline Maid, Mrs. Freshley&rsquo;s, Merita, Cobblestone Mill, European Bakers, Mi Casa, Bunny Bread, HomePride, Tastykake, and Dave&rsquo;s Killer Bread.</li>
<li>Pepperidge Farm (Campbell&rsquo;s)</li>
<li>Wholesome Harvest (Maple Leaf Bakery)</li>
<li>Aunt Millie&rsquo;s (Perfection Bakeries, Inc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Soft white wheat (typically &lt; 10% protein) is the star ingredient in Kellogg&rsquo;s Mini Wheats and Wheat Flakes, as well as Nabisco&rsquo;s Triscuit crackers. Kellogg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Open for Breakfast&rdquo; website tells the stories of a 4,000-acre soft white wheat farm in Michigan, close to the company&rsquo;s HQ. There is some evidence that breakfast cereals made with white whole wheat hold their crispness longer in milk. Triscuit&rsquo;s product description goes, &ldquo;We like to think of Soft White Winter Wheat as a kind of cashmere of wheat because of its soft texture and delicious taste. It&rsquo;s what gives Triscuit its golden color, distinctive crunch and 24 grams of delicious whole grain goodness per serving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asians love soft white wheat, too, because they believe it makes better noodles &ndash; bright, clear white, soft inside but firm on the surface. When made with white wheat, fresh refrigerated noodles will not develop black specks.</p>
<p>In the Japanese prefecture Kagawa, the home of the <em>udon</em> noodle, a white wheat reclamation is underway. Before the 1960s, fields of wheat covered the town of Sanuki (the old name of Kagawa). The local Sanuki wheat would be harvested, milled and sifted to make flour for Sanuki <em>udon</em>. But after repeated bad weather in the early 1960s, wheat production declined sharply and imported Australian Standard White (ASW) wheat soon became the major variety. Some local noodle makers and aficionados found imported wheat to be inferior and produced subpar <em>udon</em> flour, so they worked together with small farmers to revive Kagawa&rsquo;s soul food, i.e. <em>udon</em> made from Sanuki-grown wheat. In 2000, they developed a new variety of wheat for <em>udon</em> named <em>sanuki no yume</em> (&ldquo;Sanuki&rsquo;s dream&rdquo;) and later in 2009 a newer variety based on the OG. Since 2013, almost the entire wheat field in Kawaga grows <em>sanuki no yume</em> 2009. Kinoshita Flour Mills in Kagawa sells a <em>udon</em> flour made with 100% Kagawa-grown wheat (8.5% protein). They use a meticulous milling process to remove all the bran because, as explained on their website, &ldquo;speck, a small piece of bran, would damage the taste and the food texture of the Udon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They can keep their noodles, I will make bread. There are thousands of other foods I would rather eat. <em>Mon pain quotidien</em>, first and foremost.</p>
<h4 id=milling>Milling<a href=#milling class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Bread made from finely milled wholegrain flour has a tender texture, a slight chew, a rustic hue, and robust wheat flavor.</p>
<p><code>Note</code>: Working with freshly milled single-varietal whole grains is not as predictable as a standard bag of King Arthur or other name-brand Ô¨Çour, which remain consistent by blending varieties of wheats from multiple years or regions. Whole grains are living and vibrant; shelf-stable flours are dead. Working with whole grains is challenging and requires you to be willing to learn new skills and pay greater attention to the process, rather than relying on recipes where you can simply plug in your ingredients and yield the same results. Grains are a lot like coffee &ndash; you have to think about, &ldquo;When was this roasted? When was this ground?&rdquo; You can taste the difference in Ô¨Çavor and texture.</p>
<p>Freshly milled flour works a bit differently from shelf-stable flour:</p>
<ol>
<li>It contains more enzymes and minerals, and ferments faster than store-bought ones;</li>
<li>It contains volatile oils from the bran and germ; store-bought flour has had some oils evaporated off or may not even have had the germ in it, depending on the brand.</li>
</ol>
<p>Freshly milled wholegrain flour is best for Desem, the old Flemish method specifically developed for 100% wholegrain bread.</p>
<h4 id=bolting>Bolting<a href=#bolting class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>I ground up the wheat berries in a grain mill, and sifted the flour through a mesh sieve to screen out the coarsest bits.</p>
<p>Bolted flour contains almost all of the germ, and the softer parts of the bran. In exchange for a loss of mainly fiber and minerals, the resulting flour performs more like a bread or all-purpose flour while maintaining some of the rich flavor, nutritional benefits, and lovely color of wholegrain flours. It has a creamy texture.</p>
<p>Historically, bolted flour was sifted through <a href=https://www.angelfire.com/journal/millbuilder/boulting.html>a piece of cloth</a>. Nowadays it&rsquo;s typically done through a metal or plastic screen.</p>
<p>The total flour out of the sifter divided by the total flour out of the mill would give you the extraction percentage. The higher the percentage, the closer to whole grain flour it is. 100% extraction is whole wheat. Home-milling and bolting wheat will give you incredible flavor that&rsquo;s impossible to beat.</p>

<p>Do the same thing with whole rye berries &ndash; mill them, but skip the bolting. Leave the rye flour coarse and wholesome. Rye is a cousin to wheat and mills similarly, but the two have very different baking qualities.</p>
<p>IMO, rye is one of the tastiest, most nutrient-dense grains. It yields a peppery-earthy flavor and improves the keeping quality of whatever you make with it. Feeding sourdough starter with rye keeps it vigorous, sour and fruity.</p>
<p>Abruzzi rye is an Italian heirloom variety. The kernels are bluish-gold in appearance, and smell nutty and sweet like a blend of herbal spices and citrus. It was famous in the Carolinas during the colonial era. Did you know it was the very rye flour used in &ldquo;thirded bread&rdquo;, a cost-cutting recipe that combined rye, wheat, and cornmeal (instead of oats) plus the sweet upgrade of molasses, such as Boston brown bread.</p>
<p>Small amounts have big results. Blending merely 5% of rye into a wheat bread will add a depth of flavor, without overpowering others.</p>
<h4 id=method>Method<a href=#method class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>I have a big batch of <em>zakvaska</em>¬†left from making rye bread <em>kvass</em>. So I used some <em>zakvaska</em>, instead of the usual WW sourdough starter, to build a 100% hydration levain for this bread. It doubled in volume overnight, brimming with bubbles.</p>
<p>I autolysed all of the flours with coffee for 1 hour. Then I added the levain and salt.</p>
<p>I did 5 folds during the first 3 hours.</p>
<p>After 5 hours of warm bulk-fermentation, I shaped the dough into a log, coated it with a handful of flaxseeds, and placed it in my ghetto banneton. I left it in the fridge overnight to proof.</p>
<p>Next day, I left the dough in a warm place for 2.5 hours to finish proofing. The dough rose 80%-90%, and felt so jiggly! Then I baked it.</p>

</figure>
<p>The bread almost tripled from the initial dough! The crust bloomed nicely from the seams and had beautifully caramelized spots.</p>

<h4 id=cooling>Cooling<a href=#cooling class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>The final stage of baking bread is letting it cool properly. If you were to slice into a hot loaf of bread, you would not be doing it any justice. The heat retained inside the bread continues to cook it and develop flavor/texture, so slicing it too early interrupts this process prematurely.¬†Also, cutting warm bread allows moisture to escape into the air, which means it will go stale faster.</p>
<p>As the breads cool, the process of starch retrogradation is completed and the water molecules move outward, evenly, toward the crust. If you were to cut into a hot loaf, the crumb is still too soft and the bread won&rsquo;t slice neatly, it will tend to be gummy and stick to your knife. Allow your loaves to firm up and cool to about body temperature before slicing. Breads that can be eaten while they are still warm are rolls and baguettes, because the crust-to-crumb ratio is so high, and there is not much further internal cooking that has to take place.</p>

<h4 id=tasting>Tasting<a href=#tasting class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>The crust is thin and crispy, and the crumb springy and soft. The cold brew coffee lent a nice color to the bread. The coffee flour definitely added a unique bite and a smoky accent. There is no smell or taste of morning Joe, but you can feel the coffee grounds caressing your tongue.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the bread with a wedge of Comt√© &ndash; a flavor explosion! The pair reminded me of condensed milk, cocoa and macadamia nut. Washed it down with some <em>el cheapo</em> Pacific Peaks merlot. The smokiness of the wine reminded me of the coffee notes in this bread.</p>

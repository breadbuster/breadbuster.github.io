<div class=post-content><div>
<p>The first time I learned about fermentation was in Puerto Rico in 2017, shortly after Christmas. I traveled to the island a few months after Hurricane Maria. A lot of businesses on the island were closed, and people were running out of everything &ndash; much like everywhere in the world right now, as a result of the Covid lockdown.</p>
<p>Back in Viejo San Juan, I stumbled across a community event on sustainable agriculture called Agro + Cultura. I hung out there all day as probably the only &ldquo;no hablo espa√±ol&rdquo; attendee, and fumbled my way through a few classes on canning taught by the <a href=https://archive.ph/0J0Dq>Queer Kitchen Brigade</a>. It was there and then that I made <em>kimchi</em> for the first time in my life, and learned about the difference between pickling and fermentation. It didn&rsquo;t click with me, until my contacts introduced me to a local politician (who was formerly a very high-ranking official at the broadly powerful <em>Banco Gubernamental de Fomento para Puerto Rico</em>, a <a href=https://archive.ph/lxHU6>driving force</a> behind Puerto Rico&rsquo;s debt crisis). In private, he bashed solar energy and dismissed local grassroots agricultural resilience movements as &ldquo;inefficient and ineffective,&rdquo; and said the island &ndash; which imports ~90% of its food and raw materials &ndash; was &ldquo;better off left alone to big corporations.&rdquo; That was a wake-up call for me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I got interested in fermentation, as a way to preserve food and build resilience. I grew up with food insecurity. Even though I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to have not experienced scarcity since college, I worry I could again someday.</p>
<p>Stories about bread lines outside food pantries across the country make me feel tremendously grateful to have learned different methods of food preservation during the golden age of American farming.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, America&rsquo;s agricultural abundance allowed me to indulge my curiosity, fortuitously at a time when commodity and consumer prices hit a new decade low. I was completely unaware that the world economy was going through a mild recession in 2019. I was able to fill up my pantry with 25-lb. bags of miscellaneous organic (pseudo)grains &ndash; wheat, rye, durum, buckwheat, teff, amaranth, quinoa, corn, barley, oat, millet, sorghum, etc. &ndash; at rock-bottom prices, just a few months before Covid. I remember Aldi was selling 5-lb. bags of all purpose flour for ~$1 back then (it costs $2.12 as of November 2022). With so much grains on hand, I made a lot of rejuvelac and built a sourdough starter from scratch. That was the beginning of my breadmaking journey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Breadbaking is one of those almost hypnotic businesses, like a dance from some ancient ceremony. It leaves you filled with one of the world&rsquo;s sweetest smells&mldr; There is no chiropractic treatment, no Yoga exercise, no hour of meditation in a music-throbbing chapel, that will leave you emptier of bad thoughts than this homely ceremony of making bread.</p>
<ul>
<li>M.F.K. Fisher, <em>The Art of Eating</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Fisher, &ldquo;I came to believe that since nobody else dared feed me as I wished to be fed, I must do it myself, and with as much aplomb as I could muster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This bread is inspired by the Caribbean <em>pan de coco</em>, to remind myself of that shock moment in Puerto Rico &ndash; resilience is independence.</p>

<p>Autolyze the flour with coconut milk. Add the levain and salt. Perform 5 folds during a 5-hour warm bulk-fermentation. Incorporate the dried fruits and most of the coconut pulp during the lamination fold. Shape and coat completely in grated coconut. Proof in the fridge for 12 hours.</p>
<p>I made a few ginormous loaves of this bread and gave all but one away.</p>
<p>The caramelized coconut-covered crust makes my mouth water.</p>

<p>The crumb is soft and creamy. It tastes a little tangy, but nicely balanced by the sweetness of dried fruits.</p>

<pre tabindex=0><code>    /\___/\ ~  .-----------------------------.
   (_o . o_)   |    Hi, I'm breadbuster üçû   |
   /     ^&quot; ~  &quot;-----------------------------&quot;
</code></pre><p>I am a self-taught hobby baker and fermentation fanatic, i.e. I do crazy experiments at home, mostly with breads. I have no formal culinary training of any kind. Just my enthusiasm and perverse curiosity that drives me to mad-scientist-like experiments that probably won&rsquo;t win a Nobel this year, or any year.</p>
<p>I consider myself a well-traveled foodie and grainiac. Hunting for different varieties of grains from all over the world has taken me down a rabbit hole of agricultural economics and global trade. I don&rsquo;t claim or pretend to be a grain connoisseur, but I love to meet my grains (as well as the farmers who grow them), and taste good grains from all over the world. I know just enough to be comfortable experimenting with various types of grains. Ego is not an ingredient in my bread.</p>
<p>I am not what you would call a &ldquo;health fanatic&rdquo; or environmental crusader. Nor am I on some quixotic quest to revamp the postmodern diet. I just enjoy discovering culinary traditions around the world and immersing myself in new cultures. Along the way, I have realized that eating good food with good company is one of life&rsquo;s greatest joys, and I will never punish myself for it.</p>
<h4 id=what-grains-do-i-use>What grains do I use?<a href=#what-grains-do-i-use class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>I buy single-variety whole grains, not flours. I buy directly from farmers, not millers.</p>
<p>I mill all of my bread flours at home from high-quality whole grains. I use an electric grain mill, and grind the grains slowly at low temperatures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It all starts with the choice of grain, which is first a question of place and time.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Karen Hess, <em>A Century of Change in the American Loaf</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I work mostly with hard wheat (>= 11% protein). You can make bread out of literally any grain.</p>
<p>I prefer red wheat to white wheat; the former contains tannins that give it a deep brown-red color and impart a more intense, earthy flavor.</p>
<p>I favor winter wheat over spring wheat. <a href=/tags/hard-red-winter-wheat/>Hard red winter wheat</a> (~12.5% protein<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>) is my go-to for baking European-style breads. A loaf made with entirely hard spring wheat (>= 13.5% protein) gives too much chew, IMO. Too much gluten isn&rsquo;t always a good thing. I blend a modest amount of HSW into HWW loaves if I want to slightly boost the gluten content.</p>
<p>I have baked with quite a few heritage <em>Triticum</em> varieties:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=/tags/turkey-red/>Turkey Red</a> (HRWW): grown in Colorado, Ohio, Missouri, Kansas, and Minnesota</li>

<li><a href=/tags/sangaste-rye/><em>Sangaste</em></a> (heritage Estonian rye): grown in Colorado</li>
</ul>

<p>I have no interest in pre-milled flours &ndash; especially commercial (white) flours made from refined wheat. Not even from brands like King Arthur and Bob&rsquo;s Red Mill. In fact, I haven&rsquo;t bought any flour since 2020. The &ldquo;whitest&rdquo; flour I bake with is ~80% extraction (hand-bolted with a sifting screen). It makes me feel absolutely involved in my breadmaking and connected with nature. Nowadays so many people shop for organic and sustainably-grown produce, humanely-raised meat, and biodynamic wine, yet they buy commercial flour right off the store shelf without even asking where it came from, how/when it was milled, or how the wheat was grown.</p>
<p>My favorite wheat flour for making bread is Kansas-grown <a href=/tags/turkey-red/>Turkey Red</a>. I consider it to be the OG American wheat and the best-tasting bread wheat. Red Fife = the OG Canadian wheat.</p>
<p>I am always eager to try new grains. If you have things to recommend, <a href=/say-hi/>give me a holler</a>.</p>
<h4 id=what-breads-do-i-make>What breads do I make?<a href=#what-breads-do-i-make class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>I like to leaven <del>exclusively</del> with <strong>sourdough</strong>, and occasionally with <a href=/tags/yeast-water>homemade yeast water</a>. I&rsquo;ve been playing with <a href=/tags/craft-beer-yeast>brewer&rsquo;s yeasts</a>. No artificial additives or synthetic enhancers.</p>
<p>Baking slowly with patience is inherently fun, and the resulting bread tastes better and connects you with Nature and people in a way that hastily produced bread can never hope to achieve.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Breadbaking is one of those almost hypnotic businesses, like a dance from some ancient ceremony. It leaves you filled with one of the world&rsquo;s sweetest smells&mldr; There is no chiropractic treatment, no yoga exercise, no hour of meditation in a music-throbbing chapel, that will leave you emptier of bad thoughts than this homely ceremony of making bread.</p>
<ul>
<li>M.F.K. Fisher, <em>The Art of Eating</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The first bread book I remember reading was Peter Reinhart&rsquo;s <em>Whole Grain Breads</em>. Ruined or galvanized? TBD&mldr; (Check out the <a href=/library/>bread books</a> that have influenced me.) Panettoni were my OG gateway drug to baking.</p>
<p>I have always been a sucker for Baltic peasant breads, especially dark-brown, moist, wholegrain loaves. IMO, the ghost-white, wheat-ish mush sold as &ldquo;bread&rdquo; is for pigeons, not humans. Wholegrain breads don&rsquo;t have to be dense or heavy, if handled skillfully.</p>
<p>I like my bread loaded with things: different grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruits, etc. The more, the merrier. I swear I must&rsquo;ve been a German squirrel in a past life. I am probably even more convinced than the Germans that bread itself <em>is</em> a (nutritious) meal. I will happily eat a few slices of <em>mehrkornbrot</em> with a wedge of cheese for dinner, √† la <em>abendbrot</em> (German &ldquo;evening bread&rdquo; custom). Bread matches people, in a way.</p>
<p>To many people, baking is an escape from daily drudgery where they essentially go through the motion of following someone else&rsquo;s instructions, turning out comforting baked goods, and snapping a bunch of stunning photos for Instagram.</p>
<p>To me, a recipe is just someone&rsquo;s lab notes detailing the procedures of an experiment. Reading a recipe from the beginning to the end usually gives me a good idea about the process and expected result, but to me every bake is an adventure into a realm unknown, an opportunity to open my mind and learn something new.</p>
<p>I grew up fascinated by Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, and Ellery Queen. When I bake, I like to use my head and pull out the magnifying glass üîé. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times the tiniest details have taken me down a rabbit hole where a whole new world opened up&mldr;</p>
<h4 id=wtf-is-the-eponymous-heresy>WTF is the eponymous &ldquo;heresy&rdquo;?<a href=#wtf-is-the-eponymous-heresy class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>A couple of years ago, I intentionally let my levain over-ripen and the high-hydration dough ferment for as long as possible &ndash; to the point that the dough itself literally became a superlevain &ndash; to develop a deep tang. I then decided to &ldquo;bake&rdquo; the bread in a buttered saucepan on a stovetop as if it were a giant English muffin, so that the bread would have a fluffy top with a crispy brown bottom, √† la the iconic Chinese <em>shengjian bao</em>. A friend of a friend called me a &ldquo;heretic&rdquo; and wrote me a long expos√©, listing every sin I had committed with my breadmaking, followed by checklist instructions on how to bake sourdough breads the <del>right</del> widely accepted way. I said thanks, bread pope, but I want to explore sourdough in my own blasphemous way and I like my bread intensely flavorful. Truth is, I have never made a bread that&rsquo;s too sour for me.</p>
<h4 id=other-sacrilegious-things-i-do-with-breads>Other sacrilegious things I do with breads<a href=#other-sacrilegious-things-i-do-with-breads class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h4>
<ul>
<li>I work with outlandishly high hydration (usually >90%). Why &ldquo;do&rdquo; when I can &ldquo;overdo&rdquo;?</li>
<li>I keep my sourdough starter extremely stiff, like <em>lievito madre</em>. I feed it with only wholegrain flour, at &lt;50% hydration.</li>
<li>I use a fairly large amount of levain (usually >=40%) in my dough, contrary to the trendy method that calls for only a tiny amount of levain.</li>
<li>I ferment my doughs for a loooong time (usually 48 hours), at very low temperatures. No rush.</li>
<li>I bake in a ghetto convection toaster oven. No pre-heating. No cast-iron Dutch ovens, fancy breadware, pizza stones, or lava rocks. No Br√∏d & Taylor folding bread proofer, either.</li>
<li>I bake my dough seam-side up, like Ken Forkish, so that it finds its own breaking points.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t bake for Instagram. That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m a bread baker and eater, not a content creator. I care <em>a lot more</em> about what precisely goes into my bread than how it looks. There is a widely accepted but often unspoken standard for how artisan breads <em>should</em> look. In the age of Instagram, who isn&rsquo;t drawn to a beautifully presented loaf of bread with a dramatic surface ear or an intricate pattern? I eat with my tongue and my gut, not my eyes. √Ä la Capital One&rsquo;s famous ad slogan, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in Your Wallet?&rdquo; I&rsquo;d like to ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in your bread?&rdquo;</li>
<li>My breads never turn out exactly the same twice, and I really like that. Consistency is overrated and boring. I&rsquo;d rather go for the very good all the time and the occasional exceptional accident that blows my mind.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=bake-heretically>Bake heretically<a href=#bake-heretically class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Baking bread in my own heretical way has taught me how to live my life the way I want to, and have faith in being who I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to pretend to be someone I&rsquo;m not, in order to please others or meet their expectations.</p>
<p>My bread is an expression of me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.</p>
<ul>
<li>T.S. Eliot</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This corner of the internet is an ongoing repository of my lab notes. It serves as a playground for creativity and expression, as well as a sort of pseudo-system that helps me keep track of where my ingredients come from and who grew them.</p>
<p>You are welcome to replicate my experiments, but I&rsquo;d rather that you seek inspiration from them and wander off on your own to figure out your unique style. Following recipes to the letter teaches you very little, apart from a slavish obedience to directions. Loosen up. Be creative and inventive, even spontaneous.</p>
<p>If you like what you are reading here, feel free to <a href=/say-hi/>drop me a line</a> or spread the word.</p>
<p>Have fun baking!</p>

<p>The same grain can have different flavors and protein contents depending on the area they come from, the farming method, the application of nitrate fertilizers, and a growing year&rsquo;s weather conditions. The <em>vignerons</em> of France coined the term &ldquo;terroir&rdquo; to describe the complex interaction between land, soil and micro-climate that influences a vine&rsquo;s grapes. Similarly, &ldquo;terroir&rdquo; influences the taste and quality of a grain. When harvested, the grain has become the sum of this growing year, a statement of its terroir.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
